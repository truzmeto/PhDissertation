Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) often acquire unique structure upon binding to
other molecules. Expanded conformation and highly dynamic nature of IDPs encourage fast
molecular recognition associated with coupled folding and binding. While fast association is
important to propagate a signal, rapid dissociation is also essential in facilitating optimized
signal switching upon binding multiple partners in the cell. In this work, using
pKID-KIX IDP complex as model system, we explore binding properties that give
rise to rapid association and dissociation by performing structure based model simulations.
Implementing modifications and parametrization into the model, we study how the degree of
intrinsic disorder and the speed of conformational dynamics influence properties of the
encounter complex in order to elucidate the binding mechanism of IDPs.
