 title={Neither Two-State nor Three-State: Dimerization of Lambda Cro Repressor},
 author={Yao, John and Wang, Jin},
 abstract={Lambda Cro repressor is one of the best studied dimeric transcription
 factors. However, there has still been an unsettled debate for decades about whether it is a
 two-state dimer or three-state dimer. We provide a new mechanism model that can
 reconcile these seemingly conflicting (mutually exclusive) experimental results. From
 simulations with all-atom structure-based model, we observe that the dimerization process
 of Lambda Cro repressor starts from one folded monomer with one unfolded monomer.
 Intrasubunit folding and intersubunit binding are partially coupled, in a fly casting manner.},

@article{zheng:12p,
 title={Predictive energy landscapes for protein--protein association},
 abstract={We investigate protein–protein association using the associative-
 memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM),
 a coarse-grained protein folding model that has been optimized
 using energy-landscape theory. The potential was originally pa-
 rameterized by enforcing a funneled nature for a database of di-
 meric interfaces but was later further optimized to create funneled
 folding landscapes for individual monomeric proteins. The ability
 of the model to predict interfaces was not tested previously. The
 present results show that simulated annealing of the model in-
 deed is able to predict successfully the native interfaces of eight
 homodimers and four heterodimers, thus amounting to a flexible
 docking algorithm. We go on to address the relative importance
 of monomer geometry, flexibility, and nonnative intermonomeric
 contacts in the association process for the homodimers. Monomer
 surface geometry is found to be important in determining the bind-
 ing interface, but it is insufficient. Using a uniform binding poten-
 tial rather than the water-mediated potential results in sampling of
 misbound structures that are geometrically preferred but are none-
 theless energetically disfavored by AWSEM, as well as in nature.
 Depending on the stability of the unbound monomers, nonnative
 contacts play different roles in the association process. For unstable
 monomers, thermodynamic states stabilized by nonnative interac-
 tions correspond to productive, on-pathway intermediates and
 can, therefore, catalyze binding through a fly-casting mechanism.
 For stable monomers, in contrast, states stabilized by nonnative
 interactions generally correspond to traps that impede binding.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a coarse-grained model of DNA with bases modeled as rigid-body ellipsoids to capture their anisotropic stereochemistry. Interaction potentials are all physicochemical and generated from all-atom simulation/parameterization with minimal phenomenology. Persistence length, degree of stacking, and twist are studied by molecular dynamics simulation as functions of temperature, salt concentration, sequence, interaction potential strength, and local position along the chain for both single- and double-stranded DNA where appropriate. The model of DNA shows several phase transitions and crossover regimes in addition to dehybridization, including unstacking, untwisting, and collapse, which affect mechanical properties such as rigidity and persistence length. The model also exhibits chirality with a stable right-handed and metastable left-handed helix.},

	Abstract = {The binding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to structured targets is gaining increasing attention. Here we review experimental and computational studies on the binding kinetics of IDPs. Experiments have yielded both the binding rate constants and the binding mechanisms, the latter via mutation and deletion studies and NMR techniques. Most computational studies have aimed at qualitative understanding of the binding rate constants or at mapping the free energy surfaces after the IDPs are engaged with their targets. The experiments and computation show that IDPs generally gain structures after they are engaged with their targets; that is, interactions with the targets facilitate the IDPs' folding. It also seems clear that the initial contact of an IDP with the target is formed by just a segment, not the entire IDP. The docking of one segment to its sub-site followed by coalescing of other segments around the corresponding sub-sites emerges as a recurring feature in the binding of IDPs. Such a dock-and-coalesce model forms the basis for quantitative calculation of binding rate constants. For both disordered and ordered proteins, strong electrostatic attraction with their targets can enhance the binding rate constants by several orders of magnitude. There are now tremendous opportunities in narrowing the gap in our understanding of IDPs relative to ordered proteins with regard to binding kinetics.},

	Abstract = {An 'intrinsically disordered protein' (IDP) is assumed to be unfolded in the cell and perform its biological function in that state. We contend that most intrinsically disordered proteins are in fact proteins waiting for a partner (PWPs), parts of a multi-component complex that do not fold correctly in the absence of other components. Flexibility, not disorder, is an intrinsic property of proteins, exemplified by X-ray structures of many enzymes and protein-protein complexes. Disorder is often observed with purified proteins in vitro and sometimes also in crystals, where it is difficult to distinguish from flexibility. In the crowded environment of the cell, disorder is not compatible with the known mechanisms of protein-protein recognition, and, foremost, with its specificity. The self-assembly of multi-component complexes may, nevertheless, involve the specific recognition of nascent polypeptide chains that are incompletely folded, but then disorder is transient, and it must remain under the control of molecular chaperones and of the quality control apparatus that obviates the toxic effects it can have on the cell.},

In recent years numerous studies have addressed the structural properties of the unfolded proteins in the absence of their ligands. Surprisingly few time-resolved investigations on coupled folding and binding reactions have been published up to date and the dynamics and kinetic mechanisms of these processes are still only poorly understood. Especially, it is still unsolved for most systems which conformation of the protein is recognized by the ligand (conformational selection vs. folding-after-binding) and whether the ligand influences the folding kinetics. Here we review experimental methods, kinetic models and time-resolved experimental studies of coupled folding and binding reactions.},

	Abstract = {Theory and computation have long been used to rationalize the experimental association rate constants of protein-protein complexes, and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, in particular, have been successful in reproducing the relative rate constants of wild-type and mutant protein pairs. Missing from previous BD studies of association kinetics, however, has been the description of hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between, and within, the diffusing proteins. Here we address this issue by rigorously including HIs in BD simulations of the barnase-barstar association reaction. We first show that even very simplified representations of the proteins--involving approximately one pseudoatom for every three residues in the protein--can provide excellent reproduction of the absolute association rate constants of wild-type and mutant protein pairs. We then show that simulations that include intermolecular HIs also produce excellent estimates of association rate constants, but, for a given reaction criterion, yield values that are decreased by ∼35-80% relative to those obtained in the absence of intermolecular HIs. The neglect of intermolecular HIs in previous BD simulation studies, therefore, is likely to have contributed to the somewhat overestimated absolute rate constants previously obtained. Consequently, intermolecular HIs could be an important component to include in accurate modeling of the kinetics of macromolecular association events.},

	Abstract = {Much work in recent years has been devoted to understanding the complex process of protein aggregation. This review looks at the earliest stages of aggregation, long before the formation of fibrils that are the hallmark of many aggregation-based diseases, and proposes that the first steps are controlled by the reconfiguration dynamics of the monomer. When reconfiguration is much faster or much slower than bimolecular diffusion, then aggregation is slow, but when they are similar, aggregation is fast. The experimental evidence for this model is reviewed and the prospects for small molecule aggregation inhibitors to prevent disease are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Biomolecular function is realized by recognition, and increasing evidence shows that recognition is determined not only by structure but also by flexibility and dynamics. We explored a biomolecular recognition process that involves a major conformational change - protein folding. In particular, we explore the binding-induced folding of IA3, an intrinsically disordered protein that blocks the active site cleft of the yeast aspartic proteinase saccharopepsin (YPrA) by folding its own N-terminal residues into an amphipathic alpha helix. We developed a multi-scaled approach that explores the underlying mechanism by combining structure-based molecular dynamics simulations at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic level. Both the free energy profile and the associated kinetic paths reveal a common scheme whereby IA3 binds to its target enzyme prior to folding itself into a helix. This theoretical result is consistent with recent time-resolved experiments. Furthermore, exploration of the detailed trajectories reveals the important roles of non-native interactions in the initial binding that occurs prior to IA3 folding. In contrast to the common view that non-native interactions contribute only to the roughness of landscapes and impede binding, the non-native interactions here facilitate binding by reducing significantly the entropic search space in the landscape. The information gained from multi-scaled simulations of the folding of this intrinsically disordered protein in the presence of its binding target may prove useful in the design of novel inhibitors of aspartic proteinases.},

	Abstract = {α-Synuclein is a protein that is intrinsically disordered in vitro and prone to aggregation, particularly at high temperatures. In this work, we examined the ability of curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, to prevent aggregation of the protein. We found strong binding of curcumin to α-synuclein in the hydrophobic non-amyloid-β component region and complete inhibition of oligomers or fibrils. We also found that the reconfiguration rate within the unfolded protein was significantly increased at high temperatures. We conclude that α-synuclein is prone to aggregation because its reconfiguration rate is slow enough to expose hydrophobic residues on the same time scale that bimolecular association occurs. Curcumin rescues the protein from aggregation by increasing the reconfiguration rate into a faster regime.},

	Abstract = {The intrachain reaction theory of Wilemki and Fixman [(1974) J. Chem. Phys.60, 866--877] is used to assess the influence of internal DNA motions on various protein--DNA association schemes. It is found that, for large proteins, the diffusional association rate can be totally dominated by these motions rather than by the free-trans-lational diffusion rates. Also, the time required for the diffusion together of two DNA segments is estimated. This estimate can be used to provide an upper limit for the rate of intrachain cyclization, and also for the effective intrachain transfer rate of a protein bound to a DNA chain.},

	Abstract = {We hypothesize that the first step of aggregation of disordered proteins, such as α-synuclein, is controlled by the rate of backbone reconfiguration. When reconfiguration is fast, bimolecular association is not stable, but as reconfiguration slows, association is more stable and subsequent aggregation is faster. To investigate this hypothesis, we have measured the rate of intramolecular diffusion in α-synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson's disease, under solvent conditions that accelerate or decelerate aggregation. Using the method of tryptophan-cysteine (Trp-Cys) quenching, the rate of intramolecular contact is measured in four different loops along the chain length. This intrinsically disordered protein is highly diffusive at low temperature at neutral pH, when aggregation is slow, and compacts and diffuses more slowly at high temperature or low pH, when aggregation is rapid. Diffusion also slows with the disease mutation A30P. This work provides unique insights into the earliest steps of α-synuclein aggregation pathway and should provide the basis for the development of drugs that can prevent aggregation at the initial stage.},

	Abstract = {Recent experiments showed that the reconfiguration dynamics of unfolded proteins are often adequately described by simple polymer models. In particular, the Rouse model with internal friction (RIF) captures internal friction effects as observed in single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies of a number of proteins. Here we use RIF, and its non-free draining analog, Zimm model with internal friction, to explore the effect of internal friction on the rate with which intramolecular contacts can be formed within the unfolded chain. Unlike the reconfiguration times inferred from FCS experiments, which depend linearly on the solvent viscosity, the first passage times to form intramolecular contacts are shown to display a more complex viscosity dependence. We further describe scaling relationships obeyed by contact formation times in the limits of high and low internal friction. Our findings provide experimentally testable predictions that can serve as a framework for the analysis of future studies of contact formation in proteins.},

	Abstract = {Conformational rearrangements in biomolecules (such as protein folding or enzyme-ligand binding) are often interpreted in terms of low-dimensional models of barrier crossing such as Kramers' theory. Dimensionality reduction, however, entails memory effects; as a result, the effective frictional drag force along the reaction coordinate nontrivially depends on the time scale of the transition. Moreover, when both solvent and "internal" friction effects are important, their interplay results in a highly nonlinear dependence of the effective friction on solvent viscosity that is not captured by common phenomenological models of barrier crossing. Here, these effects are illustrated using an analytically solvable toy model of an unstructured polymer chain involved in an inter- or intramolecular transition. The transition rate is calculated using the Grote-Hynes and Langer theories, which--unlike Kramers' theory--account for memory. The resulting effective frictional force exerted by the polymer along the reaction coordinate can be rationalized in terms of the effective number of monomers engaged in the transition. Faster transitions (relative to the polymer reconfiguration time scale) involve fewer monomers and, correspondingly, lower friction forces, because the polymer chain does not have enough time to reconfigure in response to the transition.},

	Abstract = {The quantitative description of polymeric systems requires hierarchical modeling schemes, which bridge the gap between the atomic scale, relevant to chemical or biomolecular reactions, and the macromolecular scale, where the longest relaxation modes occur. Here, we use the formalism for diffusion-controlled reactions in polymers developed by Wilemski, Fixman, and Doi to discuss the renormalisation of the reactivity parameters in polymer models with varying spatial resolution. In particular, we show that the adjustments are independent of chain length. As a consequence, it is possible to match reactions times between descriptions with different resolution for relatively short reference chains and to use the coarse-grained model to make quantitative predictions for longer chains. We illustrate our results by a detailed discussion of the classical problem of chain cyclization in the Rouse model, which offers the simplest example of a multi-scale descriptions, if we consider differently discretized Rouse models for the same physical system. Moreover, we are able to explore different combinations of compact and non-compact diffusion in the local and large-scale dynamics by varying the embedding dimension.},

	Abstract = {Proteins function by interacting with other molecules, where both native and nonnative interactions play important roles. Native interactions contribute to the stability and specificity of a complex, whereas nonnative interactions mainly perturb the binding kinetics. For intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which do not adopt rigid structures when being free in solution, the role of nonnative interactions may be more prominent in binding processes due to their high flexibilities. In this work, we investigated the effect of nonnative hydrophobic interactions on the coupled folding and binding processes of IDPs and its interplay with chain flexibility by conducting molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that the free-energy profiles became rugged, and intermediate states occurred when nonnative hydrophobic interactions were introduced. The binding rate was initially accelerated and subsequently dramatically decreased as the strength of the nonnative hydrophobic interactions increased. Both thermodynamic and kinetic analysis showed that disordered systems were more readily affected by nonnative interactions than ordered systems. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the kinetic advantage of IDPs ("fly-casting" mechanism) was enhanced by nonnative hydrophobic interactions. The relationship between chain flexibility and protein aggregation is also discussed.},

We consider an alternative, "avant-garde view" in which proteins are conformationally dynamic and exhibit functional promiscuity. We surmise that these properties are the foundation stones of protein evolvability; they facilitate the divergence of new functions within existing folds and the evolution of entirely new folds. Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability, and poorly packed, disordered, and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability. This dynamic view of protein structure, function, and evolvability is extrapolated to describe hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of the early proteins and future research directions in the area of protein dynamism and evolution.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding rates vary by several orders of magnitude and they depend on the topology of the fold and the size and composition of the sequence. Although recent works show that the rates can be predicted from the sequence, allowing for high-throughput annotations, they consider only the sequence and its predicted secondary structure. We propose a novel sequence-based predictor, PFR-AF, which utilizes solvent accessibility and residue flexibility predicted from the sequence, to improve predictions and provide insights into the folding process. The predictor includes three linear regressions for proteins with two-state, multistate, and unknown (mixed-state) folding kinetics. PFR-AF on average outperforms current methods when tested on three datasets. The proposed approach provides high-quality predictions in the absence of similarity between the predicted and the training sequences. The PFR-AF's predictions are characterized by high (between 0.71 and 0.95, depending on the dataset) correlation and the lowest (between 0.75 and 0.9) mean absolute errors with respect to the experimental rates, as measured using out-of-sample tests. Our models reveal that for the two-state chains inclusion of solvent-exposed Ala may accelerate the folding, while increased content of Ile may reduce the folding speed. We also demonstrate that increased flexibility of coils facilitates faster folding and that proteins with larger content of solvent-exposed strands may fold at a slower pace. The increased flexibility of the solvent-exposed residues is shown to elongate folding, which also holds, with a lower correlation, for buried residues. Two case studies are included to support our findings.},

	Abstract = {With recent advances in single-molecule manipulation techniques, it is now possible to measure the mechanical resistance of proteins to external pulling forces applied at specific positions. Remarkably, such recent studies demonstrated that the pulling/stretching forces required to initiate unfolding vary considerably depending on the location of the application of the forces, unraveling residue/position-specific response of proteins to uniaxial tension. Here we show that coarse-grained elastic network models based on the topology of interresidue contacts in the native state can satisfactory explain the relative sizes of such stretching forces exerted on different residue pairs. Despite their simplicity, such models presumably capture a fundamental property that dominates the observed behavior: deformations that can be accommodated by the relatively lower frequency modes of motions intrinsically favored by the structure require weaker forces and vice versa. The mechanical response of proteins to external stress is therefore shown to correlate with the anisotropic fluctuation dynamics intrinsically accessible in the folded state. The dependence on the overall fold implies that evolutionarily related proteins sharing common structural features tend to possess similar mechanical properties. However, the theory cannot explain the differences observed in a number of structurally similar but sequentially distant domains, such as the fibronectin domains.},

	Abstract = {The concept of a protein diffusing in its free-energy folding landscape has been fruitful for both theory and experiment. Yet the choice of the reaction coordinate (RC) introduces an undesirable degree of arbitrariness into the problem. We analyze extensive simulation data of an alpha-helix in explicit water solvent as it stochastically folds and unfolds. The free-energy profiles for different RCs exhibit significant variations, some having an activation barrier, while others not. We show that this variation has little effect on the predicted folding kinetics if the diffusivity profiles are properly taken into account. This kinetic quasi-universality is rationalized by an RC rescaling, which, due to the reparameterization invariance of the Fokker-Planck equation, allows the combination of free-energy and diffusivity effects into a single function, the rescaled free-energy profile. This rescaled free energy indeed shows less variation among different RCs than the bare free energy and diffusivity profiles separately do, if we properly distinguish between RCs that contain knowledge of the native state and those that are purely geometric in nature. Our method for extracting diffusivity profiles is easily applied to experimental single molecule time series data and might help to reconcile conflicts that arise when comparing results from different experimental probes for the same protein.},

	Abstract = {We used nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion to characterize higher energy conformational substates of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. Each intermediate in the catalytic cycle samples low-lying excited states whose conformations resemble the ground-state structures of preceding and following intermediates. Substrate and cofactor exchange occurs through these excited substates. The maximum hydride transfer and steady-state turnover rates are governed by the dynamics of transitions between ground and excited states of the intermediates. Thus, the modulation of the energy landscape by the bound ligands funnels the enzyme through its reaction cycle along a preferred kinetic path.},

	Abstract = {Allostery offers a highly specific way to modulate protein function. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is of increasing interest for protein science and drug discovery. However, allosteric signal transmission is difficult to detect experimentally and to model because it is often mediated by local structural changes propagating along multiple pathways. To address this, we developed a method to identify communication pathways by an information-theoretical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Signal propagation was described as information exchange through a network of correlated local motions, modeled as transitions between canonical states of protein fragments. The method was used to describe allostery in two-component regulatory systems. In particular, the transmission from the allosteric site to the signaling surface of the receiver domain NtrC was shown to be mediated by a layer of hub residues. The location of hubs preferentially connected to the allosteric site was found in close agreement with key residues experimentally identified as involved in the signal transmission. The comparison with the networks of the homologues CheY and FixJ highlighted similarities in their dynamics. In particular, we showed that a preorganized network of fragment connections between the allosteric and functional sites exists already in the inactive state of all three proteins.},

	Abstract = {Conformational flexibility plays a central role in allosteric transition of proteins. In this paper, we extend the analysis of our previous study [S. Tripathi and J. J. Portman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 2104 (2009)] to investigate how relatively minor structural changes of the meta-stable states can significantly influence the conformational flexibility and allosteric transition mechanism. We use the allosteric transitions of the domains of calmodulin as an example system to highlight the relationship between the transition mechanism and the inter-residue contacts present in the meta-stable states. In particular, we focus on the origin of transient local unfolding (cracking), a mechanism that can lower free energy barriers of allosteric transitions, in terms of the inter-residue contacts of the meta-stable states and the pattern of local strain that develops during the transition. We find that the magnitude of the local strain in the protein is not the sole factor determining whether a region will ultimately crack during the transition. These results emphasize that the residue interactions found exclusively in one of the two meta-stable states is the key in understanding the mechanism of allosteric conformational change.},

	Abstract = {Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds approximately 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale.},

@article{wensley:12,
	Abstract = {The elongated three-helix bundle domains spectrin R16 and R17 fold some two to three orders of magnitude more slowly than their homologue R15. We have shown that this slow folding is due, at least in part, to roughness in the free-energy landscape of R16 and R17. We have proposed that this roughness is due to a frustrated search for the correct docking of partly preformed helices. However, this accounts for only a small part of the slowing of folding and unfolding. Five residues on the A helix of R15, when inserted together into R16 or R17, increase the folding rate constants, reduce landscape roughness, and alter the folding mechanism to one resembling R15. The effect of each of these mutations individually is investigated here. No one mutation causes the behavior seen for the five in combination. However, two mutations, E18F and K25V, significantly increase the folding and unfolding rates of both R16 and R17 but without a concomitant loss in landscape roughness. E18F has the greatest effect on the kinetics, and a Φ-value analysis of the C helix reveals that the folding mechanism is unchanged. For both E18F and K25V the removal of the charge and resultant transition state stabilization is the main origin of the faster folding. Consequently, the major cause of the unusually slow folding of R16 and R17 is the non-native burial of the two charged residues in the transition state. The slowing due to landscape roughness is only about fivefold.},

	Abstract = {Molecular recognition is determined by the structure and dynamics of both a protein and its ligand, but it is difficult to directly assess the role of each of these players. In this study, we use Markov State Models (MSMs) built from atomistic simulations to elucidate the mechanism by which the Lysine-, Arginine-, Ornithine-binding (LAO) protein binds to its ligand. We show that our model can predict the bound state, binding free energy, and association rate with reasonable accuracy and then use the model to dissect the binding mechanism. In the past, this binding event has often been assumed to occur via an induced fit mechanism because the protein's binding site is completely closed in the bound state, making it impossible for the ligand to enter the binding site after the protein has adopted the closed conformation. More complex mechanisms have also been hypothesized, but these have remained controversial. Here, we are able to directly observe roles for both the conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms in LAO binding. First, the LAO protein tends to form a partially closed encounter complex via conformational selection (that is, the apo protein can sample this state), though the induced fit mechanism can also play a role here. Then, interactions with the ligand can induce a transition to the bound state. Based on these results, we propose that MSMs built from atomistic simulations may be a powerful way of dissecting ligand-binding mechanisms and may eventually facilitate a deeper understanding of allostery as well as the prediction of new protein-ligand interactions, an important step in drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {The prediction of protein-protein kinetic rate constants provides a fundamental test of our understanding of molecular recognition, and will play an important role in the modeling of complex biological systems. In this paper, a feature selection and regression algorithm is applied to mine a large set of molecular descriptors and construct simple models for association and dissociation rate constants using empirical data. Using separate test data for validation, the predicted rate constants can be combined to calculate binding affinity with accuracy matching that of state of the art empirical free energy functions. The models show that the rate of association is linearly related to the proportion of unbound proteins in the bound conformational ensemble relative to the unbound conformational ensemble, indicating that the binding partners must adopt a geometry near to that of the bound prior to binding. Mirroring the conformational selection and population shift mechanism of protein binding, the models provide a strong separate line of evidence for the preponderance of this mechanism in protein-protein binding, complementing structural and theoretical studies.},

	Abstract = {To investigate a putatively primordial protein we have simplified the sequence of a 56-residue alpha/beta fold (the immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G) by replacing it with polyalanine, polythreonine, and diglycine segments at regions of the sequence that in the folded structure are alpha-helical, beta-strand, and turns, respectively. Remarkably, multiple folding and unfolding events are observed in a 15-micros molecular dynamics simulation at 330 K. The most stable state (populated at approximately 20%) of the simplified-sequence variant of protein G has the same alpha/beta topology as the wild-type but shows the characteristics of a molten globule, i.e., loose contacts among side chains and lack of a specific hydrophobic core. The unfolded state is heterogeneous and includes a variety of alpha/beta topologies but also fully alpha-helical and fully beta-sheet structures. Transitions within the denatured state are very fast, and the molten-globule state is reached in <1 micros by a framework mechanism of folding with multiple pathways. The native structure of the wild-type is more rigid than the molten-globule conformation of the simplified-sequence variant. The difference in structural stability and the very fast folding of the simplified protein suggest that evolution has enriched the primordial alphabet of amino acids mainly to optimize protein function by stabilization of a unique structure with specific tertiary interactions.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion on a low-dimensional free-energy surface is a remarkably successful model for the folding dynamics of small single-domain proteins. Complicating the interpretation of both simulations and experiments is the expectation that the effective diffusion coefficient D will in general depend on the position along the folding coordinate, and this dependence may vary for different coordinates. Here we explore the position dependence of D, its connection to protein internal friction, and the consequences for the interpretation of single-molecule experiments. We find a large decrease in D from unfolded to folded, for reaction coordinates that directly measure fluctuations in Cartesian configuration space, including those probed in single-molecule experiments. In contrast, D is almost independent of Q, the fraction of native amino acid contacts: Near the folded state, small fluctuations in position cause large fluctuations in Q, and vice versa for the unfolded state. In general, position-dependent free energies and diffusion coefficients for any two good reaction coordinates that separate reactant, product, and transition states, are related by a simple transformation, as we demonstrate. With this transformation, we obtain reaction coordinates with position-invariant D. The corresponding free-energy surfaces allow us to justify the assumptions used in estimating the speed limit for protein folding from experimental measurements of the reconfiguration time in the unfolded state, and also reveal intermediates hidden in the original free-energy projection. Lastly, we comment on the design of future single-molecule experiments that probe the position dependence of D directly.},

	Abstract = {Understanding molecular kinetics, and particularly protein folding, is a classic grand challenge in molecular biophysics. Network models, such as Markov state models (MSMs), are one potential solution to this problem. MSMs have recently yielded quantitative agreement with experimentally derived structures and folding rates for specific systems, leaving them positioned to potentially provide a deeper understanding of molecular kinetics that can lead to experimentally testable hypotheses. Here we use existing MSMs for the villin headpiece and NTL9, which were constructed from atomistic simulations, to accomplish this goal. In addition, we provide simpler, humanly comprehensible networks that capture the essence of molecular kinetics and reproduce qualitative phenomena like the apparent two-state folding often seen in experiments. Together, these models show that protein dynamics are dominated by stochastic jumps between numerous metastable states and that proteins have heterogeneous unfolded states (many unfolded basins that interconvert more rapidly with the native state than with one another) yet often still appear two-state. Most importantly, we find that protein native states are hubs that can be reached quickly from any other state. However, metastability and a web of nonnative states slow the average folding rate. Experimental tests for these findings and their implications for other fields, like protein design, are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Transition states are defined as points in configuration space with the highest probability that trajectories passing through them are reactive (i.e., form transition paths between reactants and products). In the high-friction (diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively. An algorithm is proposed to calculate rate coefficients from the transition-path and equilibrium ensembles by estimating the frequency of transitions between reactants and products.},

	Abstract = {We formulate a general theory of the diffusion-influenced kinetics of irreversible bimolecular reactions occurring in the low concentration limit. Starting from the classical Liouville equation for the reactants and explicit solvent molecules, a formally exact expression for the bimolecular reaction rate coefficient is derived; the structures of reactant molecules and the sink functions may be arbitrarily complicated. The present theoretical formulation shows clearly how the well-known Noyes and Wilemski-Fixman rate theories are related and can be improved in a systematic manner. The general properties of the rate coefficient such as the long-time behavior and the upper and the lower bounds are analyzed. When the reaction can occur at a range of distance, the non-Markovianity of repeated encounter events between a reactant pair becomes significant and either the Noyes theory or the Wilemski-Fixman theory fails. The present theory provides a practical method for calculating the rate expression for such reactions, which improves significantly on the Wilemski-Fixman theory.},

	Abstract = {The binding of a ligand molecule to a protein is often accompanied by conformational changes of the protein. A central question is whether the ligand induces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and stabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of ground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the binding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In this model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand. The first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is off, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound. The induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground state, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state. We find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in the two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is fast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium constant, whereas the off-rate is independent. In the case of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein binds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by mutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other "perturbations" that only affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such mutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only the off-rate.},

	Abstract = {Protein interactions within regulatory networks should adapt in a spatiotemporal-dependent dynamic environment, in order to process and respond to diverse and versatile cellular signals. However, the principles governing recognition pliability in protein complexes are not well understood. We have investigated a region of the intrinsically disordered protein myelin basic protein (MBP(145-165)) that interacts with calmodulin, but that also promiscuously binds other biomolecules (membranes, modifying enzymes). To characterize this interaction, we implemented an NMR spectroscopic approach that calculates, for each conformation of the complex, the maximum occurrence based on recorded pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings. We found that the MBP(145-165)-calmodulin interaction is characterized by structural heterogeneity. Quantitative comparative analysis indicated that distinct conformational landscapes of structural heterogeneity are sampled for different calmodulin-target complexes. Such structural heterogeneity in protein complexes could potentially explain the way that transient and promiscuous protein interactions are optimized and tuned in complex regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins that acquire their three dimensional structures only upon binding to their targets are very important in cellular signal regulation. While experimental studies have been made on the structures of both bound (structured) and unbound (disordered) states, less is known about the actual folding-binding transition. Coarse grained simulations using native-centric (i.e. G{\=o}) potentials have been particularly useful in addressing this problem, given the large search space for IDP binding, but have well-known deficiencies in reproducing the unfolded state structure and dynamics. Here, we investigate the interaction of HIF1α with CBP using a hierarchy of coarse-grained models, in each case matching the binding affinity at 300 K to the experimental value. Starting from a pure G{\=o}-like model based on the native structure of the complex we go on to consider a more realistic model of helix propensity in the HIF1α, and finally the effect of non-native interactions between binding partners. We find structural disorder (i.e."fuzziness") in the bound state of HIF1α in all models which is supported by the results of atomistic simulations. Correcting the over-stabilized helices in the unbound state gives rise to a more cooperative folding-binding transition (destabilizing partially bound intermediates). Adding non-native contacts lowers the free energy barrier for binding to an almost barrierless scenario, leading to higher binding/unbinding rates relative to the other models, in better agreement with the near diffusion-limited binding rates measured experimentally. Transition state structures for the three models are highly disordered, supporting a fly-casting mechanism for binding.},

	Abstract = {To understand the interplay of residual structures and conformational fluctuations in the interaction of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), we first combined implicit solvent and replica exchange sampling to calculate atomistic disordered ensembles of the nuclear co-activator binding domain (NCBD) of transcription coactivator CBP and the activation domain of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator ACTR. The calculated ensembles are in quantitative agreement with NMR-derived residue helicity and recapitulate the experimental observation that, while free ACTR largely lacks residual secondary structures, free NCBD is a molten globule with a helical content similar to that in the folded complex. Detailed conformational analysis reveals that free NCBD has an inherent ability to substantially sample all the helix configurations that have been previously observed either unbound or in complexes. Intriguingly, further high-temperature unbinding and unfolding simulations in implicit and explicit solvents emphasize the importance of conformational fluctuations in synergistic folding of NCBD with ACTR. A balance between preformed elements and conformational fluctuations appears necessary to allow NCBD to interact with different targets and fold into alternative conformations. Together with previous topology-based modeling and existing experimental data, the current simulations strongly support an "extended conformational selection" synergistic folding mechanism that involves a key intermediate state stabilized by interaction between the C-terminal helices of NCBD and ACTR. In addition, the atomistic simulations reveal the role of long-range as well as short-range electrostatic interactions in cooperating with readily fluctuating residual structures, which might enhance the encounter rate and promote efficient folding upon encounter for facile binding and folding interactions of IDPs. Thus, the current study not only provides a consistent mechanistic understanding of the NCBD/ACTR interaction, but also helps establish a multi-scale molecular modeling framework for understanding the structure, interaction, and regulation of IDPs in general.},

	Abstract = {The EF-hand superfamily of proteins is characterized by the presence of calcium binding helix-loop-helix structures. Many of these proteins undergo considerable motion responsible for a wide range of properties upon binding but the exact mechanism at the root of this motion is not fully understood. Here, we use an unbiased accelerated multiscale simulation scheme, coupled with two force fields - CHARMM-EEF1 and the extended OPEP - to explore in details the closing pathway, from the unbound holo state to the closed apo state, of two EF-hand proteins, the Calmodulin and Troponin C N-terminal nodules. Based on a number of closing simulations for these two sequences, we show that the EF-hand β-scaffold, identified as crucial by Grabarek for the EF-hand opening driven by calcium binding, is also important in closing the EF-hand. We also show the crucial importance of the phenylalanine situated at the end of first EF-hand helix, and identify an intermediate state modulating its behavior, providing a detailed picture of the closing mechanism for these two representatives of EF-hand proteins.},

Based on an analysis of the pulling forces, the dissociation sequences and the structural changes, we show that the Ca(2+)-coordinating residues lose their binding to Ca(2+) in a stepwise fashion. The two Ca(2+) ions dissociate from the two EF-hands simultaneously, with two distinct groups among the five Ca(2+)-coordinating residues affecting the EF-hand conformational changes differently. These results provide new insights into the effects of Ca(2+) on calmodulin conformation, from which a novel sequential mechanism of Ca(2+)-calmodulin dissociation is proposed.},

	Abstract = {Conformational transitions are functionally important in many proteins. In the enzyme adenylate kinase (AK), two small domains (LID and NMP) close over the larger CORE domain; the reverse (opening) motion limits the rate of catalytic turnover. Here, using double-well G{\=o} simulations of Escherichia coli AK, we elaborate on previous investigations of the AK transition mechanism by characterizing the contributions of rigid-body (Cartesian), backbone dihedral, and contact motions to transition-state (TS) properties. In addition, we compare an apo simulation to a pseudo-ligand-bound simulation to reveal insights into allostery. In Cartesian space, LID closure precedes NMP closure in the bound simulation, consistent with prior coarse-grained models of the AK transition. However, NMP-first closure is preferred in the apo simulation. In backbone dihedral space, we find that, as expected, backbone fluctuations are reduced in the O/C transition in parts of all three domains. Among these "quenching" residues, most in the CORE, especially residues 11-13, are rigidified in the TS of the bound simulation, while residues 42-44 in the NMP are flexible in the TS. In contact space, in both apo and bound simulations, one nucleus of closed-state contacts includes parts of the NMP and CORE; CORE-LID contacts are absent in the TS of the apo simulation but formed in the TS of the bound simulation. From these results, we predict mutations that will perturb the opening and/or closing transition rates by changing the entropy of dihedrals and/or the enthalpy of contacts. Furthermore, regarding allostery, the fully closed structure is populated in the apo simulation, but our contact results imply that ligand binding shifts the preferred O/C transition pathway, thus precluding a simple conformational selection mechanism. Finally, the analytical approach and the insights derived from this work may inform the rational design of flexibility and allostery in proteins.},

	Abstract = {Coupled binding and folding is frequently involved in specific recognition of so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a newly recognized class of proteins that rely on a lack of stable tertiary fold for function. Here, we exploit topology-based G{\=o}-like modeling as an effective tool for the mechanism of IDP recognition within the theoretical framework of minimally frustrated energy landscape. Importantly, substantial differences exist between IDPs and globular proteins in both amino acid sequence and binding interface characteristics. We demonstrate that established G{\=o}-like models designed for folded proteins tend to over-estimate the level of residual structures in unbound IDPs, whereas under-estimating the strength of intermolecular interactions. Such systematic biases have important consequences in the predicted mechanism of interaction. A strategy is proposed to recalibrate topology-derived models to balance intrinsic folding propensities and intermolecular interactions, based on experimental knowledge of the overall residual structure level and binding affinity. Applied to pKID/KIX, the calibrated G{\=o}-like model predicts a dominant multistep sequential pathway for binding-induced folding of pKID that is initiated by KIX binding via the C-terminus in disordered conformations, followed by binding and folding of the rest of C-terminal helix and finally the N-terminal helix. This novel mechanism is consistent with key observations derived from a recent NMR titration and relaxation dispersion study and provides a molecular-level interpretation of kinetic rates derived from dispersion curve analysis. These case studies provide important insight into the applicability and potential pitfalls of topology-based modeling for studying IDP folding and interaction in general.},

	Abstract = {Association between signaling proteins and their cellular targets is generally thought to be highly specific (implicating a high association constant, K(a)) and, at the same time, transient or short-lived (corresponding to a high dissociation rate constant, k(d)). However, a combination of high K(a) and high k(d) would lead to a high association rate constant (k(a) = K(a)k(d)), which poses a problem because there is a limit to which k(a) can be increased, set by the diffusional approach to form the complex. In this Opinion article, I propose that having the signaling protein disordered before binding to the target provides a way out of this quandary. The intrinsic disorder of the signaling protein would decrease K(a) without sacrificing the specificity of the complex, and thus would allow k(d) to be increased to a range appropriate for signaling.},

	Abstract = {Temperature-jump relaxation spectrometry has been used to study the unfolding properties of Ca(2+)-free Drosophila calmodulin from 278 to 336 K, monitored by absorption of Tyr-138. The T-jump amplitude data are well fitted throughout with a melting temperature T(m) = 315.7 K, deltaH(o)(m) = 140.5 kJ mol(-1) and deltaC(p)(o) = 3.28 kJ K(-1) mol(-1), giving deltaG(o)(293) = 7.36 kJ mol(-1) for the C-domain, in good agreement with other data. The relaxation rate observed (time range 1 micros-1 ms) obeys a simple two-state kinetic mechanism throughout. The activation energy for unfolding is nearly temperature-independent, in contrast to that for refolding, and hence the transition state is relatively compact, resembling the folded state, and the relaxation time, tau, shows complex temperature dependence. The domain unfolding is a two-state process occurring with tau of approximately 100 micros at the T(m). At 296 K, when the C-domain is approximately 6% unfolded, k(unfolding) approximately 305 s(-1), k(refolding) approximately 4660 s(-1) and tau approximately 200 micros. This closely resembles the rate and extent of a reported C-domain exchange process, inferred from NMR line-broadening at 296 K. The inherent instability of the apo-C-domain of calmodulin indicates that the unfolded form significantly contributes to the physical properties of apo-calmodulin at normal temperatures, and this instability is enhanced by low ionic strength conditions.},

	Abstract = {Despite the large and complex conformational space available to an unfolded protein, many small globular proteins fold with simple two-state cooperative kinetics. Understanding what determines folding rates beyond simple rules summarizing kinetic trends has proved to be more elusive than predicting folding mechanism. Topology-based models with smooth energy landscapes give reasonable predictions of the structure of the transition state ensemble, but do not have the kinetic or thermodynamic cooperativity exhibited by two-state proteins. This review outlines some recent efforts to understand what determines the cooperativity and the diversity of folding rates of two-state folding proteins.},

	Abstract = {The quantitative description of polymeric systems requires hierarchical modeling schemes, which bridge the gap between the atomic scale, relevant to chemical or biomolecular reactions, and the macromolecular scale, where the longest relaxation modes occur. Here, we use the formalism for diffusion-controlled reactions in polymers developed by Wilemski, Fixman, and Doi to discuss the renormalisation of the reactivity parameters in polymer models with varying spatial resolution. In particular, we show that the adjustments are independent of chain length. As a consequence, it is possible to match reactions times between descriptions with different resolution for relatively short reference chains and to use the coarse-grained model to make quantitative predictions for longer chains. We illustrate our results by a detailed discussion of the classical problem of chain cyclization in the Rouse model, which offers the simplest example of a multi-scale descriptions, if we consider differently discretized Rouse models for the same physical system. Moreover, we are able to explore different combinations of compact and non-compact diffusion in the local and large-scale dynamics by varying the embedding dimension.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding should be complex. Proteins organize themselves into specific three-dimensional structures, through a myriad of conformational changes. The classical view of protein folding describes this process as a nearly sequential series of discrete intermediates. In contrast, the energy landscape theory of folding considers folding as the progressive organization of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which the protein passes on its way to the natively folded structure. As a result of evolution, proteins have a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. Connecting theory and simulations of minimalist models with experiments has completely revolutionized our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control protein folding.},

	Abstract = {In receptor-ligand binding, a question that generated considerable interest is whether the mechanism is induced fit or conformational selection. This question is addressed here by a solvable model, in which a receptor undergoes transitions between active and inactive forms. The inactive form is favored while unbound but the active form is favored while a ligand is loosely bound. As the active-inactive transition rates increase, the binding mechanism gradually shifts from conformational selection to induced fit. The timescale of conformational transitions thus plays a crucial role in controlling binding mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Conformational change during protein-ligand binding may significantly affect both the binding mechanism and the rate constant. Most earlier theories and simulations treated conformational change as stochastic gating with transition rates between reactive and nonreactive conformations uncoupled to ligand binding. Recently, we introduced a dual-transition-rates model in which the transition rates between reactive and nonreactive conformations depend on the protein-ligand distance [H.-X. Zhou, Biophys. J. 98, L15 (2010)]. Analytical results of that model showed that the apparent binding mechanism switches from conformational selection to induced fit, when the rates of conformational transitions increase from being much slower than the diffusional approach of the protein-ligand pair to being much faster. The conformational-selection limit (k(CS)) and the induced-fit limit (k(IF)) provide lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the binding rate constant. Here we introduce a general model in which the energy surface of the protein in conformational space is coupled to ligand binding, and present a method for calculating the binding rate constant from Brownian dynamics simulations. Analytical and simulation results show that, for an energy surface that switches from favoring the nonreactive conformation while the ligand is away to favoring the reactive conformation while the ligand is near, k(CS) and k(IF) become close and, thus, provide tight bounds to the binding rate constant. This finding has significant mechanistic implications and presents routes for obtaining good estimates of the rate constant at low cost.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)
can be coupled with F€orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
to detect intramolecular dynamics of proteins on the microsecond
time scale. Here we describe application of FRET-FCS
to detect fluctuations within the N-terminal and C-terminal
domains of the Ca2+-signaling protein calmodulin. Intramolecular
fluctuations were resolved by global fitting of the two fluorescence
autocorrelation functions (greengreen and red-red)
together with the two cross-correlation functions (green-red and red-green). To match the F€orster radius for FRET to the
dimensions of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, a near-infrared acceptor fluorophore (Atto 740) was coupled with a greenemitting
donor (Alexa Fluor 488). Fluctuations were detected in both domains on the time scale of 30 to 40 μs. In the N-terminal
domain, the amplitude of the fluctuations was dependent on occupancy of Ca2+ binding sites. A high amplitude of dynamics in apocalmodulin
(in the absence of Ca2+) was nearly abolished at a high Ca2+ concentration. For the C-terminal domain, the dynamic
amplitude changed little with Ca2+ concentration. The Ca2+ dependence of dynamics for the N-terminal domain suggests that the
fluctuations detected by FCS in the N-terminal domain are coupled to the opening and closing of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding loops.},

	Abstract = {Coarse-grained, self-contained polymer models are powerful tools in the study of protein folding. They are also essential to assess predictions from less rigorous theoretical approaches that lack an explicit-chain representation. Here we review advances in coarse-grained modeling of cooperative protein folding, noting in particular that the Levinthal paradox was raised in response to the experimental discovery of two-state-like folding in the late 1960s, rather than to the problem of conformational search per se. Comparisons between theory and experiment indicate a prominent role of desolvation barriers in cooperative folding, which likely emerges generally from a coupling between local conformational preferences and nonlocal packing interactions. Many of these principles have been elucidated by native-centric models, wherein nonnative interactions may be treated perturbatively. We discuss these developments as well as recent applications of coarse-grained chain modeling to knotted proteins and to intrinsically disordered proteins.},

	Abstract = {Polymer chains, confined to cavities or polymer layers with dimensions less than the chain radius of gyration, appear in many phenomena, such as gel chromatography, rubber elasticity, viscolelasticity of high molar mass polymer melts, the translocation of polymers through nanopores and nanotubes, polymer adsorption, etc. Thus, the description of how the constraints alter polymer thermodynamic properties is a recurrent theoretical problem. A realistic treatment requires the incorporation of impenetrable interacting (attractive or repulsive) boundaries, a process that introduces significant mathematical complications. The standard approach involves developing the generalized diffusion equation description of the interaction of flexible polymers with impenetrable confining surfaces into a discrete eigenfunction expansion, where the solutions are normally truncated at the first mode (the "ground state dominance" approximation). This approximation is mathematically well justified under conditions of strong confinement, i.e., a confinement length scale much smaller than the chain radius of gyration, but becomes unreliable when the polymers are confined to dimensions comparable to their typically nanoscale size. We extend a general approach to describe polymers under conditions of weak to moderate confinement and apply this semianalytic method specifically to determine the thermodynamics and static structure factor for a flexible polymer confined between impenetrable interacting parallel plate boundaries. The method is first illustrated by analyzing chain partitioning between a pore and a large external reservoir, a model system with application to chromatography. Improved agreement is found for the partition coefficients of a polymer chain in the pore geometry. An expression is derived for the structure factor S(k) in a slit geometry to assist in more accurately estimating chain dimensions from scattering measurements for thin polymer films.},

	Abstract = {We present theory showing that confining a protein to a small inert space (a ``cage'') should stabilize the protein against reversible unfolding. Examples of such spaces might include the pores within chromatography columns, the Anfinsen cage in chaperonins, the interiors of ribosomes, or regions of steric occlusion inside cells. Confinement eliminates some expanded configurations of the unfolded chain, shifting the equilibrium from the unfolded state toward the native state. The partition coefficient for a protein in a confined space is predicted to decrease significantly when the solvent is changed from native to denaturing conditions. Small cages are predicted to increase the stability of the native state by as much as 15 kcal/mol. Confinement may also increase the rates of protein or RNA folding.},

	Abstract = {A statistical mechanical ``zipper'' model is applied to describe the equilibrium melting of short DNA hairpins with poly(dT) loops ranging from 4 to 12 bases in the loop. The free energy of loop formation is expressed in terms of the persistence length of the chain. This method provides a new measurement of the persistence length of single-stranded DNA, which is found to be 1.4 nm for poly(dT) strands in 100 mM NaCl. The free energy of the hairpin relative to the random coil state is found to scale with the loop size with an apparent exponent of 7, much larger than the exponent of 1.5--1.8 expected from considerations of loop entropy alone. This result indicates a strong dependence of the excess stability of the hairpins, from stacking interactions of the bases within the loop, on the size of the loop. We interpret this excess stability as arising from favorable hydrophobic interactions among the bases in tight loops and which diminish as the loops get larger. Free energy profiles along a generalized reaction coordinate are calculated from the equilibrium zipper model. The transition state for hairpin formation is identified as an ensemble of looped conformations with one basepair closing the loop, and with a lower enthalpy than the random coil state. The equilibrium model predicts apparent activation energy of −11 kcal/mol for the hairpin closing step, in remarkable agreement with the value obtained from kinetics measurements.

@article{zhang:08a,
	Abstract = {Conformational entropy makes important contribution to the stability and folding of RNA molecule, but it is challenging to either measure or compute conformational entropy associated with long loops. We develop optimized discrete k-state models of RNA backbone based on known RNA structures for computing entropy of loops, which are modeled as self-avoiding walks. To estimate entropy of hairpin, bulge, internal loop, and multibranch loop of long length (up to 50), we develop an efficient sampling method based on the sequential Monte Carlo principle. Our method considers excluded volume effect. It is general and can be applied to calculating entropy of loops with longer length and arbitrary complexity. For loops of short length, our results are in good agreement with a recent theoretical model and experimental measurement. For long loops, our estimated entropy of hairpin loops is in excellent agreement with the Jacobson-Stockmayer extrapolation model. However, for bulge loops and more complex secondary structures such as internal and multibranch loops, we find that the Jacobson-Stockmayer extrapolation model has large errors. Based on estimated entropy, we have developed empirical formulae for accurate calculation of entropy of long loops in different secondary structures. Our study on the effect of asymmetric size of loops suggest that loop entropy of internal loops is largely determined by the total loop length, and is only marginally affected by the asymmetric size of the two loops. Our finding suggests that the significant asymmetric effects of loop length in internal loops measured by experiments are likely to be partially enthalpic. Our method can be applied to develop improved energy parameters important for studying RNA stability and folding, and for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. The discrete model and the program used to calculate loop entropy can be downloaded at http://gila.bioengr.uic.edu/resources/RNA.html.},

@article{tinoco:99,
	Abstract = {We describe the RNA folding problem and contrast it with the much more difficult protein folding problem. RNA has four similar monomer units, whereas proteins have 20 very different residues. The folding of RNA is hierarchical in that secondary structure is much more stable than tertiary folding. In RNA the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2+. Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an RNA from its sequence. However, to solve the RNA folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites. These data, together with force versus extension measurements on single RNA molecules, should provide the information necessary to test and refine the proposed algorithm.

	Abstract = {We discuss the physics of RNA as described by its secondary structure. We examine the static properties of a homogeneous RNA model that includes pairing and base stacking energies as well as entropic costs for internal loops. For large enough loop costs the model exhibits a thermal denaturation transition which we analyze in terms of the radius of gyration. We point out an inconsistency in the standard approach to RNA secondary structure prediction for large molecules. Under an external force a second-order phase transition between a globular and an extended phase takes place. A Harris-type criterion shows that sequence disorder does not affect the correlation length exponent while the other critical exponents are modified in the glass phase. However, at high temperatures, on a coarse-grained level, disordered RNA is well described by a homogeneous model. The characteristics of force-extension curves are discussed as a function of the energy parameters. We show that the force transition is always second order. A reentrance phenomenon relevant for real disordered RNA is predicted.},

	Abstract = {Natural protein domains must be sufficiently stable to fold but often need to be locally unstable to function. Overall, strong energetic conflicts are minimized in native states satisfying the principle of minimal frustration. Local violations of this principle open up possibilities to form the complex multifunnel energy landscapes needed for large-scale conformational changes. We survey the local frustration patterns of allosteric domains and show that the regions that reconfigure are often enriched in patches of highly frustrated interactions, consistent both with the idea that these locally frustrated regions may act as specific hinges or that proteins may "crack" in these locations. On the other hand, the symmetry of multimeric protein assemblies allows near degeneracy by reconfiguring while maintaining minimally frustrated interactions. We also anecdotally examine some specific examples of complex conformational changes and speculate on the role of frustration in the kinetics of allosteric change.},

	Abstract = {Proteins have often evolved sequences so as to acquire the ability for regulation via allosteric conformational change. Here we investigate how allosteric dynamics is designed through sequences with nonlinear interaction features. First, for 71 allosteric proteins of which two, open and closed, structures are available, a statistical survey of interactions using an all-atom model with effective solvation shows that those residue contact interactions specific to one of the two states are significantly weaker than are the contact interactions shared by the two states. This interaction feature indicates there is underlying sequence design to facilitate conformational change. Second, based on the energy landscape theory, we implement these interaction features into a new atomic-interaction-based coarse-grained model via a multiscale simulation protocol (AICG). The AICG model outperforms standard coarse-grained models for predictions of the native-state mean fluctuations and of the conformational change direction. Third, using the new model for adenylate kinase, we show that intrinsic fluctuations in one state contain rare and large-amplitude motions nearly reaching the other state. Such large-amplitude motions are realized partly by sequence specificity and partly by the nonlinear nature of contact interactions, leading to cracking. Both features enhance conformational transition rates.},

	Abstract = {Confinement and crowding are two major factors that can potentially impact protein folding in cellular environments. Theories based on considerations of excluded volumes predict disparate effects on protein folding stability for confinement and crowding: confinement can stabilize proteins by over 10k(B)T but crowding has a very modest effect on stability. On the other hand, confinement and crowding are both predicted to favor conformations of the unfolded state which are compact, and consequently may increase the folding rate. These predictions are largely borne out by experimental studies of protein folding under confined and crowded conditions in the test tube. Protein folding in cellular environments is further complicated by interactions with surrounding surfaces and other factors. Concerted theoretical modeling and test-tube and in vivo experiments promise to elucidate the complexity of protein folding in cellular environments.},

	Abstract = {Single molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments are used to infer the properties of the denatured state ensemble (DSE) of proteins. From the measured average FRET efficiency, <E>, the distance distribution P(R) is inferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single parameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, wormlike chain, or self-avoiding walk) for P(R) is determined by equating the calculated and measured <E>. In order to assess the accuracy of this "standard procedure," we consider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [<E> and P(R)] can be analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for which accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed <E> for the GRM and protein L, we infer P(R) using the standard procedure. We find that the mean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10\% relative error) using <E> and polymer models for P(R). However, the value extracted for the radius of gyration (R(g)) and the persistence length (l(p)) are less accurate. For protein L, the errors in the inferred properties increase as the GdmCl concentration increases for all polymer models. The relative error in the inferred R(g) and l(p), with respect to the exact values, can be as large as 25\% at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a self-consistency test, requiring measurements of <E> by attaching dyes to different residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE using the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM shows that even for this simple model, which exhibits an order-->disorder transition, the Gaussian P(R) is inadequate. Analysis of experimental data of FRET efficiencies with dyes at several locations for the cold shock protein, and simulations results for protein L, for which accurate FRET efficiencies between various locations were computed, shows that at high GdmCl concentrations there are significant deviations in the DSE P(R) from the Gaussian model.},

	Abstract = {We develop an analytical method for studying the properties of a noninteracting wormlike chain (WLC) in confined geometries. The mean-field-like theory replaces the rigid constraints of confinement with average constraints, thus allowing us to develop a tractable method for treating a WLC wrapped on the surface of a sphere, and fully encapsulated within it. The efficacy of the theory is established by reproducing the exact correlation functions for a WLC confined to the surface of a sphere. In addition, the coefficients in the free energy are exactly calculated. We also describe the behavior of a surface-confined chain under external tension that is relevant for single molecule experiments on histone-DNA complexes. The force-extension curves display spatial oscillations, and the extension of the chain, whose maximum value is bounded by the sphere diameter, scales as f−1 at large forces, in contrast to the unconfined chain that approaches the contour length as f−1∕2. A WLC encapsulated in a sphere, that is relevant for the study of the viral encapsulation of DNA, can also be treated using the mean-field approach. The predictions of the theory for various correlation functions are in excellent agreement with Langevin simulations. We find that strongly confined chains are highly structured by examining the correlations using a local winding axis. The predicted pressure of the system is in excellent agreement with simulations but, as is known, is significantly lower than the pressures seen for DNA packaged in viral capsids.},

	Abstract = {We consider the nucleation of amyloid fibrils at the molecular level when the process takes place by a direct polymerization of peptides or protein segments into β-sheets. Employing the atomistic nucleation theory (ANT), we derive a general expression for the work to form a nanosized amyloid fibril (protofilament) composed of successively layered β-sheets. The application of this expression to a recently studied peptide system allows us to determine the size of the fibril nucleus, the fibril nucleation work, and the fibril nucleation rate as functions of the supersaturation of the protein solution. Our analysis illustrates the unique feature of ANT that the size of the fibril nucleus is a constant integer in a given supersaturation range. We obtain the ANT nucleation rate and compare it with the rates determined previously in the scope of the classical nucleation theory (CNT) and the corrected classical nucleation theory (CCNT). We find that while the CNT nucleation rate is orders of magnitude greater than the ANT one, the CCNT and ANT nucleation rates are in very good quantitative agreement. The results obtained are applicable to homogeneous nucleation, which occurs when the protein solution is sufficiently pure and/or strongly supersaturated.},

Curvature can be dynamically modulated by changes in lipid composition, the oligomerization of curvature scaffolding proteins and the reversible insertion of protein regions that act like wedges in membranes. There is an interplay between curvature-generating and curvature-sensing proteins during vesicle budding. This is seen during vesicle budding and in the formation of microenvironments. On a larger scale, membrane curvature is a prime player in growth, division and movement.},

	Abstract = {Alpha-synuclein is an intrinsically unfolded protein that can adopt a partially helical structure when it interacts with different lipid membranes. Its pathological relevance is linked to its involvement in several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Typical of such ailments is the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in a beta-structure that can be soluble or precipitate. This review focuses on the structural knowledge acquired in recent years on the various conformations accessible to alpha-synuclein and to its pathologically relevant mutants. Furthermore, the role of the different variables of the chemical environments that govern the equilibria among the accessible conformations is also reviewed. The hypotheses that rationalize the relevance of the individual structural features and conformations for the physiological function of the protein or for its purported pathological role are described and compared.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) differ from "normal" ordered proteins at several levels, structural, functional and conformational. Amino acid biases characteristic for IDPs determine their structural variability and lack of rigid well-folded structure. This structural plasticity is necessary for the unique functional repertoire of IDPs, which is complementary to the catalytic activities of ordered proteins. Amino acid biases also drive atypical responses of IDPs to changes in their environment. The conformational behavior of IDPs is characterized by the low cooperativity (or the complete lack thereof) of the denaturant-induced unfolding, lack of the measurable excess heat absorption peak(s) characteristic for the melting of ordered proteins, "turned out" response to heat and changes in pH, the ability to gain structure in the presence of various counter ions, osmolytes, membranes and binding partners, and by the unique response to macromolecular crowding. This review describes some of the most characteristic features of the IDP conformational behavior and the unique response of IDPs to changes in their environment.},

@article{mihajlovic:08,
	Abstract = {Aggregation and fibrillation of alpha-synuclein bound to membranes are believed to be involved in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. On SDS micelles, the N-terminus of alpha-synuclein forms two curved helices linked by a short loop. However, its structure on lipid bilayers has not been experimentally resolved. Using MD simulations with an implicit membrane model we show here that, on a planar mixed membrane, the truncated alpha-synuclein (residues 1-95) forms a bent helix. Bending of the helix is not due to the protein sequence or membrane binding, but to collective motions of the long helix. The backbone of the helix is approximately 2.5 A above the membrane surface, with some residues partially inserted in the membrane core. The helix periodicity is 11/3 (11 residues complete three full turns) as opposed to 18/5 periodicity of an ideal alpha-helix, with hydrophobic residues towards the membrane, negatively charged residues towards the solvent and lysines on the polar/nonpolar interface. A series of threonines, which are characteristic for alpha-synuclein and perhaps a phosphorylation site, is also located at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface with their side chain often hydrogen bonded to the main-chain atom. The calculations show that the energy penalty for change in periodicity from the 18/5 to 11/3 on the anionic membrane is overcome by favorable solvation energy. The binding of truncated alpha-synuclein to membranes is weak. It prefers anionic membranes but it also binds marginally to a neutral membrane, via its C-terminus. Dimerization of helical monomers on the mixed membrane is energetically favorable. However, it slightly interferes with membrane binding. This might promote lateral diffusion of the protein on the membrane surface and facilitate assembly of oligomers that precede fibrillation.},

	Abstract = {The Parkinson's disease-related protein α-Synuclein (αS) is a 140 residue intrinsically disordered protein. Its membrane-binding properties are thought to be relevant for its physiological or pathologic activity. Here, the interaction of αS with POPG [1-Palmitoyl-2-Oleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-(Phosphorac-(1-glycerol))] small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) is investigated by spin-label EPR using double electron−electron resonance (DEER). Intermolecular distances between four single mutants reveal that well-defined aggregates are formed. The data suggest a coexistence of two dimer structures with main interactions in the helix 2, encompassing residues 50−100. Previously, the horseshoe conformation was detected by intramolecular restraints obtained by DEER on αS double mutants (Drescher et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 7796). The present study suggests that interdigitation of two monomers in the aggregate fills the void between the two helices of each of the monomers thus providing a rationale for the horseshoe structure. This aggregate is lipid induced and affects the structure of the POPG SUVs, which become leaky and diminish in size upon contact with αS suggesting a possible origin of conflicting results in the recent literature (Jao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008, 105 (50), 19666; Georgieva et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130 (39), 12856; Bortolus et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 6690).},

	Abstract = {alpha-Synuclein is a small cytosolic protein of presynaptic nerve terminals composed of seven 11-residue repeats and a hydrophilic tail. alpha-Synuclein misfolding and dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and neurodegenerative dementias, but its normal folding and function are unknown. In solution, alpha-synuclein is natively unstructured but assumes an alpha-helical conformation upon binding to phospholipid membranes. We now show that this conformation of alpha-synuclein consists of two alpha-helical regions that are interrupted by a short break. The structural organization of the alpha-helices of alpha-synuclein was not anticipated by sequence analyses and may be important for its pathogenic role.},

	Abstract = {The binding of peptides or proteins to a bilayer membrane is often coupled with a random coil-->alpha-helix transition. Knowledge of the energetics of this membrane-induced folding event is essential for the understanding of the mechanism of membrane activity. In a recent study [Wieprecht et al., J. Mol. Biol. 294 (1999) 785-794], we have developed an approach which allows an analysis of the energetics of membrane-induced folding. We have systematically varied the helix content of the amphipathic peptide magainin-2-amide by synthesizing analogs where two adjacent amino acid residues were substituted by their corresponding D-enantiomers and have measured their binding to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Correlation of the binding parameters with the helicities allowed the evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters of helix formation. Since SUVs (30 nm in diameter) are characterized by a non-ideal lipid packing due to their high membrane curvature, we have now extended our studies to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (100 nm in diameter) with a lipid packing close to planar membranes. While the free energy of binding was similar for SUVs and LUVs, the binding enthalpies and entropies were distinctly different for the two membrane systems. The thermodynamic parameters of the coil-helix transition were nevertheless not affected by the vesicle size. Helix formation at the membrane surface of LUVs (SUVs) was characterized by an enthalpy change of -0.8 (-0.7) kcal/mol per residue, an entropy change of-2.3 (-1.9) cal/mol K per residue, and a free energy change of -0.12 (-0.14) kcal/mol per residue. Helix formation accounted for approximately 50\% of the free energy of binding underlining its major role as a driving force for membrane-binding.},

@article{seelig:04,
	Abstract = {This review is focused on peptide molecules which exhibit a limited solubility in the aqueous phase and bind to the lipid membrane from the aqueous medium. Surface adsorption, membrane insertion, and specific binding are usually accompanied by changes in the heat content of the system and can be measured conveniently with isothermal titration calorimetry, avoiding the necessity of peptide labeling. The driving forces for peptide adsorption and binding are hydrophobicity, electrostatics, and hydrogen bonding. An exclusively hydrophobic interaction is exemplified by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A. Its insertion into the membrane can be described by a simple partition equilibrium X(b)=K(0)C(eq). If peptide and membrane are both charged, electrostatic interactions are dominant leading to nonlinear binding curves. The concentration of the peptide near the membrane interface can then be much larger than its bulk concentration. Electrostatic effects must be accounted for by means of the Gouy-Chapman theory before conventional binding models can be applied. A small number of peptides and proteins bind with very high affinity to a specific lipid species only. This is illustrated for the lantibiotic cinnamycin (Ro 09-0198) which forms a 1:1 complex with phosphatidyethanolamine with a binding constant of 10(8) M(-1). Membrane adsorption and insertion can be accompanied by conformational transitions facilitated, in part, by hydrogen bonding mechanisms. The two membrane-induced conformational changes to be discussed are the random coil-to-alpha-helix transition of amphipathic peptides and the random coil-to-beta-structure transition of Alzheimer peptides.},

	Abstract = {α-Synuclein is a highly conserved presynaptic protein of unknown function. A mutation in the protein has been causally linked to Parkinson's disease in humans, and the normal protein is an abundant component of the intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) characteristic of the disease. α-Synuclein is also the precursor to an intrinsic component of extracellular plaques in Alzheimer's disease. The α-synuclein sequence is largely composed of degenerate 11-residue repeats reminiscent of the amphipathic α-helical domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. We hypothesized that α-synuclein should associate with phospholipid bilayers and that this lipid association should stabilize an α-helical secondary structure in the protein. We report that α-synuclein binds to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge. We further show that the protein associates preferentially with vesicles of smaller diameter (20--25 nm) as opposed to larger (∼125 nm) vesicles. Lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity from 3% to approximately 80%. These observations are consistent with a role in vesicle function at the presynaptic terminal.

Here we describe how, with regard to lipid composition, the physicochemical features of some amphipathic helices explain their ability to recognize membrane curvature or to participate in membrane remodeling. We propose that sensing highly-curved membranes requires that the polar and hydrophobic faces of the helix do not cooperate in lipid binding. A more detailed description of the interaction between amphipathic helices and lipids is however needed; notably to explain how new helices contribute to detection of modest changes in curvature or even negative curvature.},

	Abstract = {Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is an unstructured polypeptide hormone that is cosecreted with insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, IAPP undergoes a transition from its natively disordered state to a highly ordered, all-beta-strand amyloid fiber. Although predominantly disordered, IAPP transiently samples alpha-helical structure in solution. IAPP adopts a fully helical structure when bound to membrane surfaces in a process associated with catalysis of amyloid formation. Here, we use spectroscopic techniques to study the structure of full-length, monomeric IAPP under amyloidogenic conditions. We observe that the residues with helical propensity in solution (1-22) also form the membrane-associated helix. Additionally, reduction of the N-terminal disulfide bond (Cys2-Cys7) decreases the extent of helix formed throughout this region. Through manipulation of sample conditions to increase or decrease the amount of helix, we show that the degree of helix formed affects the rate of amyloid assembly. Formation of helical structure is directly correlated with enhanced amyloid formation both on the membrane surface and in solution. These observations support suggested mechanisms in which parallel helix associations bring together regions of the peptide that could nucleate beta-strand structure.

	Abstract = {A self-consistent-field theory was developed in the grand canonical ensemble formulation to study transitions in a helix-coil multiblock globule. Helical and coil parts are treated as stiff rods and self-avoiding walks of variable lengths correspondingly. The resulting field theory takes, in addition to the conventional Zimm-Bragg, [J. Chem. Phys. 31, 526 (1959)] parameters, also three-dimensional interaction terms into account. The appropriate differential equations which determine the self-consistent fields were solved numerically with finite element method. Three different phase states are found: open chain, amorphous globule, and nematic liquid-crystalline (LC) globule. The LC-globule formation is driven by the interplay between the hydrophobic helical segment attraction and the anisotropic globule surface energy of an entropic nature. The full phase diagram of the helix-coil copolymer was calculated and thoroughly discussed. The suggested theory shows a clear interplay between secondary and tertiary structures in globular homopolypeptides.},

	Abstract = {Natively disordered proteins belong to a unique class of biomolecules whose function is related to their flexibility and their ability to adopt desired conformations upon binding to substrates. In some cases these proteins can bind multiple partners, which can lead to distinct structures and promiscuity in functions. In other words, the capacity to recognize molecular patterns on the substrate is often essential for the folding and function of intrinsically disordered proteins. Biomolecular pattern recognition is extremely relevant both in vivo (e.g., for oligomerization, immune response, induced folding, substrate binding, and molecular switches) and in vitro (e.g., for biosensing, catalysis, chromatography, and implantation). Here, we use a minimalist computational model system to investigate how polar/nonpolar patterns on a surface can induce the folding of an otherwise unstructured peptide. We show that a model peptide that exists in the bulk as a molten globular state consisting of many interconverting structures can fold into either a helix-coil-helix or an extended helix structure in the presence of a complementary designed patterned surface at low hydrophobicity (3.7\%) or a uniform surface at high hydrophobicity (50\%). However, we find that a carefully chosen surface pattern can bind to and catalyze the folding of a natively unfolded protein much more readily or effectively than a surface with a noncomplementary or uniform distribution of hydrophobic residues.},

@article{whitford:09a,
	Abstract = {Riboswitches are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in response to changing concentrations of specific metabolites. Switching activity is affected by the interplay between the aptamer domain and expression platform of the riboswitch. The aptamer domain binds the metabolite, locking the riboswitch in a ligand-bound conformation. In absence of the metabolite, the expression platform forms an alternative secondary structure by sequestering the 3' end of a nonlocal helix called P1. We use all-atom structure-based simulations to characterize the folding, unfolding, and metabolite binding of the aptamer domain of the S-adenosylmethionine-1 (SAM-1) riboswitch. Our results suggest that folding of the nonlocal helix (P1) is rate-limiting in aptamer domain formation. Interestingly, SAM assists folding of the P1 helix by reducing the associated free energy barrier. Because the 3' end of the P1 helix is sequestered by an alternative helix in the absence of metabolites, this observed ligand-control of P1 formation provides a mechanistic explanation of expression platform regulation.},

	Abstract = {The unfolding of a biomolecule by stretching force is commonly treated theoretically as one-dimensional dynamics along the reaction coordinate coincident with the direction of pulling. Here we explore a situation, particularly relevant to complex biomolecules, when the pulling direction alone is not an adequate reaction coordinate for the unfolding or rupture process. We show that in this case the system can respond to pulling force in unusual ways. Our theory points out a remarkably simple, but largely overlooked, mechanism of the complex responses of biomolecules to force. The mechanism originates from the basic property of the transition state to change its structure under applied force. A relationship is established between a key experimental observable-force-dependent lifetime-and the microscopic properties of the biomolecule in the form of an analytical solution to the problem of a force-induced molecular transition in two dimensions. The theory is applicable to biological contexts ranging from protein folding to ligand-receptor interactions.},

However, to correctly represent the structure of antiparallel beta-sheet, we have to extend the former numerical matrix to an 11x11 operator one. All calculation rules of the operators are given, which can be automatically done by computers. In the end, the partition functions for homopolymers of varied lengths, applications to experimental data, and detailed antiparallel beta-sheet/coil transition are shown.},

	Abstract = {There is much current interest in developing peptides that fold into monomeric β-sheets in aqueous solution in order to measure the forces responsible for the formation of this important protein secondary structure. To interpret results on secondary structure in peptides it is essential to use a statistical mechanical model than considers the stability of every possible conformation of the peptide. Here we develop a novel model for the β-sheet/coil equilibrium. We consider every structurally allowed conformation for sheets of two, three, or four strands, and calculate the stability of each. The model includes parameters for β-sheet preference, with or without hydrogen bonds, and for β-turn preference. We treat a β-sheet as a succession of columns with each column containing noncovalently bonded residues in the sheet. Partition functions are efficiently generated using a matrix that contains an entry for every column pair. All of the information on the sheet/coil equilibrium is contained within the partition function. We have used this to calculate the probability of forming β-sheets of two, three, or four strands as a function of β-turn and β-sheet residue preference. We find that β-hairpins and β-meanders are favored by moderate β-turn and β-sheet residue preferences, and that very stable sheets have more strands. Analysis of experimental data gives the free energy change for transferring a residue from coil to β-sheet with hydrogen bond formation as −0.7 kcal*mol-1 and without hydrogen bond formation as 0.9 kcal*mol-1 at 298 K in methanol, comparable values to those in α-helices.},

	Abstract = {Small proteins can fold remarkably rapidly, even in μs. What limits their rate of folding? The Engrailed homeodomain is a particularly well-characterized example, which folds ultrafast via an intermediate, I, of solved structure. It is a puzzle that the helix2-turn-helix3 motif of the 3-helix bundle forms in approximately 2 μs, but the final docking of preformed helix1 in I requires approximately 20 μs. Simulation and structural data suggest that nonnative interactions may slow down helix docking. Here we report the direct measurement of chain motions in I by using photoinduced electron transfer fluorescence-quenching correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS). We use a mutant that traps I at physiological ionic strength but refolds at higher ionic strength. A single Trp in helix3 quenches the fluorescence of an extrinsic label on contact with it. We placed the label along the sequence to probe segmental chain motions. At high ionic strength, we found two relaxations for all probed positions on the 2- and 20-μs time scale, corresponding to the known folding processes, and a 200-ns phase attributable to loop closure kinetics in the unfolded state. At low ionic strength, we found only the 2-μs and 200-ns phase for labels in the helix2-turn-helix3 motif of I, because the native state is not significantly populated. But for labels in helix1 we observed an additional approximately 10-μs phase showing that it was moving slowly, with a rate constant similar to that for overall folding under native conditions. Folding was rate-limited by chain motions on a rough energy surface where nonnative interactions constrain motion.},

The theoretical formalism employed is the dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) of Marini, Bettolo, Marconi and Tarazona (1999 J. Chem. Phys. 110 8032), supplied by an equilibrium excess free energy functional that is essentially exact. We complement our theoretical analysis by carrying out extensive Brownian dynamics simulations. We find excellent agreement between theory and simulations for the whole time evolution of density profiles, demonstrating thereby the validity of the DDFT when an accurate equilibrium free energy functional is employed.},

Molecular dynamics simulations are input to our equation of motion for protein dynamics, which is solved analytically to produce the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors that specify the NMR parameters. We directly compare our theoretical predictions to experiments and to simulation data for the signal transduction chemotaxis protein Y (CheY), which regulates the swimming response of motile bacteria. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with both simulations and experiments, without recourse to adjustable parameters. The theory is general, since it allows calculations of any dynamical property of interest. As an example, we present theoretical calculations of NMR order parameters and x-ray Debye-Waller temperature factors; both quantities show good agreement with experimental data.},

Whereas a Gaussian chain in the bulk can be represented by a bead-spring model with a quadratic potential between adjacent beads, the presence of a surface reduces the number of allowed chain configurations and modifies the effective potential between the beads. We derive the corrected potentials for several surface geometries: a single wall, two parallel walls (slit), and a spherical or cylindrical object (nanoparticle). Those potentials can be used in any model that includes a Gaussian chain, regardless of the simulation method. As an illustration, we consider a coarse grain model of a polymeric melt and, using Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the density profiles for (i) a melt confined in a slit and (ii) a melt in the vicinity of a nanoparticle. The case of a polymeric solution confined within a slit is also addressed, and the proposed approach is shown to yield results in qualitative agreement with those obtained with field-theoretic simulations.},

	Abstract = {Gene regulatory proteins find their target sites on DNA remarkably quickly; the experimental binding rate for lac repressor is orders-of-magnitude higher than predicted by free diffusion alone. It has been proposed that nonspecific binding aids the search by allowing proteins to slide and hop along DNA. We develop a reaction-diffusion theory of protein translocation that accounts for transport both on and off the strand and incorporates the physical conformation of DNA. For linear DNA modeled as a wormlike chain, the distribution of hops available to a protein exhibits long, power-law tails that make the long-time displacement along the strand superdiffusive. Our analysis predicts effective superdiffusion coefficients for given nonspecific binding and unbinding rate parameters. Translocation rate exhibits a maximum at intermediate values of the binding rate constant, while search efficiency is optimized at larger binding rate constant values. Thus, our theory predicts a region of values of the nonspecific binding and unbinding rate parameters that balance the protein translocation rate and the efficiency of the search. Published data for several proteins falls within this predicted region of parameter values.},

We follow the generally accepted concept that a protein propagates via two competitive modes, a three-dimensional diffusion in space and a one-dimensional sliding along the DNA. However, our theoretical treatment of the problem is new. The accuracy of our analytical model is verified by numerical simulations. The results confirm that the unspecific binding of protein to DNA, combined with sliding, is capable to reduce the reaction times significantly.},

	Abstract = {We investigate diffusion-limited reactions between a diffusing particle and a target site on a semiflexible polymer, a key factor determining the kinetics of DNA-protein binding and polymerization of cytoskeletal filaments. Our theory focuses on two competing effects: polymer shape fluctuations, which speed up association, and the hydrodynamic coupling between the diffusing particle and the chain, which slows down association. Polymer bending fluctuations are described using a mean field dynamical theory, while the hydrodynamic coupling between polymer and particle is incorporated through a simple heuristic approximation. We validate both of these through comparison to Brownian dynamics simulations. Neither of the effects has been fully considered before in the biophysical context and we show they are necessary to form accurate estimates of reaction processes. The association rate depends on the stiffness of the polymer and the particle size, exhibiting a maximum for intermediate persistence length and a minimum for intermediate particle radius. In the parameter range relevant to DNA-protein binding, the rate increase is up to 100\% compared with the Smoluchowski result for simple center-of-mass motion. The quantitative predictions made by the theory can be tested experimentally.},

@article{espinoza-fonseca:09a,
	Abstract = {In recent years, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have attracted a lot of attention given the functional importance inherent to their flexible nature. One of the most intriguing features of IDPs is their ability to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding in order to perform their function. Although the importance of intermolecular interactions involving IDPs has been widely recognized, there are divergent views on their binding mechanisms. Among the existing mechanistic models, two of them have gained popularity in the IDP field: the 'conformational selection' and the 'coupled folding and binding.' The first mechanism suggests that folding of IDPs precedes binding, while the second mechanism argues that folding may only take place upon binding. It has been suggested that both models are valid, although they work independently. However, reinterpretation of recent experimental and theoretical data indicates that both models have much more in common that it has been thought. In this manuscript, it is proposed that both mechanistic models should be merged into a single one: the synergistic model. In this model, both 'conformational selection' and 'coupled folding and binding' will synergistically participate in the binding of IDPs. To what extent each model will contribute to the full binding mechanism will depend on the required rate of binding, IDPs concentration, the native local plasticity of IDPs, the degree of binding degeneracy and the type of disorder-to-order transition. Furthermore, it is proposed that combination of the two mechanisms would bring tremendous advantages to IDP binding. For example, synergy may effectively modulate binding kinetics, balance the delicate interplay between enthalpy and entropy by using the funneled energy landscape more efficiently, thus yielding high specificity with carefully balanced free energy of binding. Given the advantages of the synergistic model, it is proposed that it will provide the basis to fully understand the complex nature of IDP binding.},

	Abstract = {We develop a toy model for predicting the rate of amyloid formation from an unfolded polypeptide. The model assumes irreversible amyloid growth, employs a collision encounter scheme and uses a Gaussian chain approximation to describe the polypeptide sequence. A principal feature of the model is its dependence on a number of key sequence residues whose correct placement, geometric arrangement and orientation in relation to their interacting partners define the success, or otherwise, of the amyloid formation reaction. Although not realistic at the molecular level, the model captures some essential features of the system and is therefore useful from a heuristic standpoint. For the case of amyloid formation from an unstructured state, the model suggests that the major determinants of the rate of fibril formation are the length of the sequence separating the critical amino acids promoting amyloid formation and the positional placement of the critical residues within the sequence. Our findings suggest also that the sequence distance between the key interacting amino acid residues may play a role in defining the maximum width of a fibril and that the addition of non-interacting segments of long structure-less polypeptide chain to an amyloidogenic peptide may act to inhibit fibril formation. We discuss these findings with reference to the placement of critical sequence residues within the polypeptide chain, the design of polypeptides with lower amyloid formation propensities and the development of aggregation inhibitors as potential therapeutics for protein depositional disorders.},

	Abstract = {Proteins are dynamic entities, and they possess an inherent flexibility that allows them to function through molecular interactions within the cell, among cells and even between organisms. Appreciation of the non-static nature of proteins is emerging, but to describe and incorporate this into an intuitive perception of protein function is challenging. Flexibility is of overwhelming importance for protein function, and the changes in protein structure during interactions with binding partners can be dramatic. The present review addresses protein flexibility, focusing on protein-ligand interactions. The thermodynamics involved are reviewed, and examples of structure-function studies involving experimentally determined flexibility descriptions are presented. While much remains to be understood about protein flexibility, it is clear that it is encoded within their amino acid sequence and should be viewed as an integral part of their structure.},

	Abstract = {The formation and duration of binary receptor−ligand complexes are fundamental to many physiologic processes. Most often, the effectiveness of interaction between a receptor and its ligand is quantified in terms of closed system, equilibrium affinity measurements, such as IC50 and Kd. In the context of in vivo biology, however, the extent and duration of responses to receptor−ligand interactions depend greatly on the time period over which the ligand is in residence on its receptor. Here we define receptor−ligand complex residence time in quantitative terms and describe its significance to biological function. Examples of the importance of residence time are presented for natural ligands of different receptor types. The impact of residence time on the optimization of potential ligands as drugs for human medicine is also described.},

	Abstract = {The rate constants for macromolecular association reactions depend on the macromolecules involved and the solution conditions. The largest rate constants are for encounter-limited reactions, where association takes place whenever the associating macromolecules collide. Macromolecules that associate through specific binding sites often have much smaller rate constants. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the rate of association for complementary nucleic acid strands can be made encounter limited by attaching weakly associating, relatively unstructured polymeric domains to the nucleic acids involved. These results have led to a model suggesting that similar domains provide a general means of increasing rates of association for specific macromolecular binding partners, both in vivo and in vitro.},

	Abstract = {Some of the rate theories that are most useful for modeling biological processes are reviewed. By delving into some of the details and subtleties in the development of the theories, the review will hopefully help the reader gain a more than superficial perspective. Examples are presented to illustrate how rate theories can be used to generate insight at the microscopic level into biomolecular behaviors. An attempt is made to clear up a number of misconceptions in the literature regarding popular rate theories, including the appearance of Planck's constant in the transition-state theory and the Smoluchowski result as an upper limit for protein-protein and protein-DNA association rate constants. Future work in combining the implementation of rate theories through computer simulations with experimental probes of rate processes, and in modeling effects of intracellular environments so that theories can be used for generating rate constants for systems biology studies is particularly exciting.},

@article{huang:10,
	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) widely participate in molecular recognition and signaling processes in cells by interacting with other molecules. Compared with ordered proteins, IDPs usually possess stronger intermolecular interactions in binding. As a result, the interface structure of IDPs in complexes is distinct from that of ordered-protein complexes, and this difference may have essential effect on the response to various perturbations in a cell. In this study, we examined the perturbations of intermolecular interactions and temperature on the coupled folding and binding processes of pKID to KIX domains by performing molecular dynamics simulations. By comparing a series of virtual pKID systems with various degree of disorder, we found that the complex stability and the binding kinetics of the disordered systems were less sensitive to the perturbations than the ordered systems. The origin of the lower response sensitivity of IDPs was attributed to their higher flexibility in the complex interface, which was further supported by an analysis on protein complex structures. On the basis of our simulations and results from the literature, we speculate IDPs may not only interact with their biological partners with high specificity and low affinity but also may be resistant to the perturbations in the environment and transmit signals fast and smooth. We proposed to name it the "kinetic buffer" effect.},

	Abstract = {Regulation of biological processes often involves phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered protein regions, thereby modulating protein interactions. Initiation of DNA replication in yeast requires elimination of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 via the SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitin ligase. Intriguingly, the substrate adapter subunit Cdc4 binds to Sic1 only after phosphorylation of a minimum of any six of the nine cyclin-dependent kinase sites on Sic1. To investigate the physical basis of this ultrasensitive interaction, we consider a mean-field statistical mechanical model for the electrostatic interactions between a single receptor site and a conformationally disordered polyvalent ligand. The formulation treats phosphorylation sites as negative contributions to the total charge of the ligand and addresses its interplay with the strength of the favorable ligand-receptor contact. Our model predicts a threshold number of phosphorylation sites for receptor-ligand binding, suggesting that ultrasensitivity in the Sic1-Cdc4 system may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions. This hypothesis is supported by experimental affinities of Cdc4 for Sic1 fragments with different total charges. Thus, polyelectrostatic interactions may provide a simple yet powerful framework for understanding the modulation of protein interactions by multiple phosphorylation sites in disordered protein regions.},

	Abstract = {Recognition requires protein flexibility because it facilitates conformational rearrangements and induced-fit mechanisms upon target binding. Intrinsic disorder is an extreme on the continuous spectrum of possible protein dynamics and its role in recognition may seem counterintuitive. However, conformational disorder is widely found in many eukaryotic regulatory proteins involved in processes such as signal transduction and transcription. Disordered protein regions may in fact confer advantages over folded proteins in binding. Rapidly interconverting and diverse conformers may create mean electrostatic fields instead of presenting discrete charges. The resultant "polyelectrostatic" interactions allow for the utilization of post-translational modifications as a means to change the net charge and thereby modify the electrostatic interaction of a disordered region. Plasticity of disordered protein states enables steric advantages over folded proteins and allows for unique binding configurations. Disorder may also have evolutionary advantages, as it facilitates alternative splicing, domain shuffling and protein modularity. As proteins exist in a continuous spectrum of disorder, so do their complexes. Indeed, disordered regions in complexes may control the degree of motion between domains, mask binding sites, be targets of post-translational modifications, permit overlapping binding motifs, and enable transient binding of different binding partners, making them excellent candidates for signal integrators and explaining their prevalence in eukaryotic signaling pathways. "Dynamic" complexes arise if more than two transient protein interfaces are involved in complex formation of two binding partners in a dynamic equilibrium. "Disordered" complexes, in contrast, do not involve significant ordering of interacting protein segments but rely exclusively on transient contacts. The nature of these interactions is not well understood yet but advancements in the structural characterization of disordered states will help us gain insights into their function and their implications for health and disease.},

	Abstract = {The 317 residue PBCV-1 mRNA capping enzyme catalyzes the second enzymatic reaction in the formation of an N-7-methyl-GMP cap on the 5'-end of the nascent mRNA. It is composed of two globular domains bound by a short flexible peptide linker, which have been shown to undergo opening and closing events. The small size and experimentally demonstrated domain mobility make the PBCV-1 capping enzyme an ideally suited model system to explore domain mobility in context of substrate binding. Here, we specifically address the following four questions: (1) How does substrate binding affect relative domain mobility: is the system better described by an induced fit or population shift mechanism? (2) What are the gross characteristics of a conformation capable of binding substrate? (3) Does "domain gating" of the active site affect the rate of substrate binding? (4) Does the magnitude of receptor conformational fluctuations confer substrate specificity by sterically occluding molecules of a particular size or geometry? We answer these questions using a combination of theory, Brownian dynamics, and molecular dynamics. Our results show that binding efficiency is a function of conformation but that isomerization between efficient and inefficient binding conformations does not impact the substrate association rate. Additionally, we show that conformational flexibility alone is insufficient to explain single stranded mRNA specificity. While our results are specific to the PBCV-1 mRNA capping enzyme, they provide a useful context within which the substrate binding behavior of similarly structured enzymes or proteins may be considered.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a two-dimensional (2D) multisurface reaction free energy description of the catalytic cycle that explicitly connects the recently observed multi-time-scale conformational dynamics as well as dispersed enzymatic kinetics to the classical Michaelis-Menten equation. A slow conformational motion on a collective enzyme coordinate Q facilitates the catalytic reaction along the intrinsic reaction coordinate X, providing a dynamic realization of Pauling's well-known idea of transition-state stabilization. The catalytic cycle is modeled as transitions between multiple displaced harmonic wells in the XQ space representing different states of the cycle, which is constructed according to the free energy driving force of the cycle. Subsequent to substrate association with the enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex under strain exhibits a nonequilibrium relaxation toward a new conformation that lowers the activation energy of the reaction, as first proposed by Haldane. The chemical reaction in X is thus enslaved to the down hill slow motion on the Q surface. One consequence of the present theory is that, in spite of the existence of dispersive kinetics, the Michaelis-Menten expression of the catalysis rate remains valid under certain conditions, as observed in recent single-molecule experiments.This dynamic theory builds the relationship between the protein conformational dynamics and the enzymatic reaction kinetics and offers a unified description of enzyme fluctuation-assisted catalysis.},

	Abstract = {Enzyme is a dynamic entity with diverse time scales, ranging from picoseconds to seconds or even longer. Here we develop a rate theory for enzyme catalysis that includes conformational dynamics as cycling on a two-dimensional (2D) reaction free energy surface involving an intrinsic reaction coordinate (X) and an enzyme conformational coordinate (Q). The validity of Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, i.e., substrate concentration dependence of enzymatic velocity, is examined under a nonequilibrium steady state. Under certain conditions, the classic MM equation holds but with generalized microscopic interpretations of kinetic parameters. However, under other conditions, our rate theory predicts either positive (sigmoidal-like) or negative (biphasic-like) kinetic cooperativity due to the modified effective 2D reaction pathway on X-Q surface, which can explain non-MM dependence previously observed on many monomeric enzymes that involve slow or hysteretic conformational transitions. Furthermore, we find that a slow conformational relaxation during product release could retain the enzyme in a favorable configuration, such that enzymatic turnover is dynamically accelerated at high substrate concentrations. The effect of such conformation retainment in a nonequilibrium steady state is evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Receiver domains are key molecular switches in bacterial signaling. Structural studies have shown that the receiver domain of the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) exists in a conformational equilibrium encompassing both inactive and active states, with phosphorylation of Asp54 allosterically shifting the equilibrium towards the active state. To analyze dynamical fluctuations and correlations in NtrC as it undergoes activation, we have applied a coarse-grained dynamics algorithm using elastic network models. Normal mode analysis reveals possible dynamical pathways for the transition of NtrC from the inactive state to the active state. The diagonalized correlation between the inactive and the active (phosphorylated) state shows that most correlated motions occur around the active site of Asp54 and in the region Thr82 to Tyr101. This indicates a coupled correlation of dynamics in the "Thr82-Tyr101" motion. With phosphorylation inducing significant flexibility changes around the active site and alpha3 and alpha4 helices, we find that this activation makes the active-site region and the loops of alpha3/beta4 and alpha4/beta5 more stable. This means that phosphorylation entropically favors the receiver domain in its active state, and the induced conformational changes occur in an allosteric manner. Analyses of the local flexibility and long-range correlated motion also suggest a dynamics criterion for determining the allosteric cooperativity of NtrC, and may be applicable to other proteins.},

	Abstract = {A transfer matrix method is described for the conformational spread CS model of allosteric cooperativity within a one-dimensional arrangement of four-state binding sites. Each such binding site can realize one of two possible conformational states. Each of these states can either bind ligand or not bind ligand. Thus, analytical expressions that are exact within the context of the CS model are derived for the grand partition function, for the mean fraction of binding sites occupied by ligand versus ligand concentration, and for the mean fraction of binding sites in a given allosteric state versus ligand concentration. The utility of our analytical results is demonstrated by least-mean-square fitting of prior experimental results obtained on the bacterial flagellar motor for the fraction of FliM/FliG/FliN complexes with CheY-P bound V. Sourjik and H. C. Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 12669 2002 and for the cw bias P. Cluzel et al., Science 287, 1652 2000, which plausibly may be identified as the fraction of protomers realizing state 2. Finally, the relationships between our analytical results and the classical Monod-Wyman-Changeaux, Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer, and McGhee-Von Hippel treatments of allosteric cooperativity are elucidated, as is the connection to an earlier approximate analytical treatment of the CS model.},

The kinetic definition of the transition state is based on the folding probability analysis method, and therefore on the selection of conformations with 0.4<Pfold<0.6, while for the equilibrium characterization we consider conformations for which the evaluated values of several reaction coordinates correspond to the maximum of the free energy measured as a function of those reaction coordinates. Our results reveal a high degree of structural similarity between the ensembles determined by the two methods. However, the folding probability distribution of the conformations belonging to our definition of the equilibrium transition state (0.2<Pfold<0.8) is broader than that displayed by the kinetic transition state.},

	Abstract = {Single molecule and NMR measurements of protein dynamics increasingly uncover the complexity of binding scenarios. Here, we describe an extended conformational selection model that embraces a repertoire of selection and adjustment processes. Induced fit can be viewed as a subset of this repertoire, whose contribution is affected by the bond types stabilizing the interaction and the differences between the interacting partners. We argue that protein segments whose dynamics are distinct from the rest of the protein ('discrete breathers') can govern conformational transitions and allosteric propagation that accompany binding processes and, as such, might be more sensitive to mutational events. Additionally, we highlight the dynamic complexity of binding scenarios as they relate to events such as aggregation and signalling, and the crowded cellular environment.},

	Abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

The landscape illustrates individual valleys, which are the conformational substates. From the functional standpoint, there are two key points: first, all functionally relevant substates pre-exist; and second, the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of the substates will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the population. This can lead to changes in the shapes and properties of target binding sites. Here we present an overview of dynamic conformational ensembles focusing on allosteric events in signaling. We propose that combining equilibrium fluctuation concepts with genomic screens could help drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {Although disordered proteins are able to carry out a variety of different functions, particularly those involved in signalling and regulation, they have been observed to perform catalysis only in a small number of cases. The presence of structural disorder is indeed expected to be poorly compatible with enzymatic catalysis, which requires a well-organised environment in the active site of the enzyme in order to facilitate the formation of the transition state of the chemical reaction to be catalysed. Despite this stringent requirement, current evidence suggests that certain partially disordered proteins could be catalytically active by becoming structured in the regions of their active sites, even if their overall states retain a significant degree of conformational heterogeneity. This type of mechanism, however, does not appear to be not very common, perhaps because the time required to the conformational search within a disordered state to establish a catalytic environment in the presence of the substrate should not be longer than the overall turnover time required for optimal function. In addition, the catalytic environment should be maintained for long enough despite the structural fluctuations to enable the catalytic reaction to take place. As some partially unstructured proteins have been reported to be capable of overcoming these severe limitations and act as enzymes, their study can increase our general understanding of the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis, as well as extend our ability to control the range of functions that can be performed by disordered proteins.},

	Abstract = {We compared here 80 different sequences containing four tracts of three guanines with loops of variable length (between 1 and 15 bases for unmodified sequences, up to 30 for fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides). All sequences were capable of forming stable quadruplexes, with Tm above physiological temperature in most cases. Unsurprisingly, the melting temperature was systematically lower in sodium than in potassium but the difference between both ionic conditions varied between 1 and >39$\,^{\circ}$C (average difference: 18.3$\,^{\circ}$C). Depending on the sequence context, and especially for G4 sequences involving two very short loops, the third one may be very long without compromising the stability of the quadruplex. A strong inverse correlation between total loop length and Tm was found in K+: each added base leads to a 2$\,^{\circ}$C drop in Tm or ∼0.3 kcal/mol loss in ΔG$\,^{\circ}$. The trend was less clear in Na+, with a longer than expected optimal loop length (up to 5 nt). This study will therefore extend the sequence repertoire of quadruplex-prone sequences, arguing for a modification of the widely used consensus (maximal loop size of 7 bases).

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: G-quadruplexes are stable four-stranded guanine-rich structures that can form in DNA and RNA. They are an important component of human telomeres and play a role in the regulation of transcription and translation. The biological significance of a G-quadruplex is crucially linked with its thermodynamic stability. Hence the prediction of G-quadruplex stability is of vital interest. RESULTS: In this article, we present a novel Bayesian prediction framework based on Gaussian process regression to determine the thermodynamic stability of previously unmeasured G-quadruplexes from the sequence information alone. We benchmark our approach on a large G-quadruplex dataset and compare our method to alternative approaches. Furthermore, we propose an active learning procedure which can be used to iteratively acquire data in an optimal fashion. Lastly, we demonstrate the usefulness of our procedure on a genome-wide study of quadruplexes in the human genome. AVAILABILITY: A data table with the training sequences is available as supplementary material. Source code is available online at http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/os252/projects/quadruplexes. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we give an overview of recent literature on the structure and stability of unimolecular G-rich quadruplex structures that are relevant to drug design and for in vivo function. The unifying theme in this review is energetics. The thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes has not been studied in the same detail as DNA and RNA duplexes, and there are important differences in the balance of forces between these classes of folded oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and DNA unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.},

	Abstract = {Nucleic acid quadruplexes, based on the guanine quartet, can arise from one or several strands, depending on the sequence. Those consisting of a single strand are usually folded in one of two principal topologies: antiparallel, in which all or half of the guanine stretches are antiparallel to each other, or parallel, in which all guanine stretches are parallel to each other. In the latter, all guanine nucleosides possess the anti conformation about the glycosidic bond, while in the former, half possess the anti conformation, and half possess the syn conformation. While antiparallel is the more common fold, examples of biologically important, parallel quadruplexes are becoming increasingly common. Thus, it is of interest to understand the forces that determine the quadruplex fold. Here, we examine the influence of individual nucleoside conformation on the overall folding topology by selective substitution of rG for dG. We can reverse the antiparallel fold of the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) by this approach. Additionally, this substitution converts a unimolecular quadruplex into a bimolecular one. Similar reverse substitutions in the all-RNA analogue of TBA result in a parallel to antiparallel change in topology and alter the strand configuration from bimolecular to unimolecular. On the basis of the specific substitutions made, we conclude that the strong preference of guanine ribonucleosides for the anti conformation is the driving force for the change in topology. These results demonstrate how conformational properties of guanine nucleosides govern not only the quadruplex folding topology but also impact quadruplex molecularity and provide a means to control these properties.},

Base pairing and stacking are treated as separate degrees of freedom, and the interplay between pairing and stacking is described by a set of local rules which mimic the geometrical constraints in the real molecule. This microscopic mechanism intrinsically accounts for the cooperativity related to the free energy penalty of bubble nucleation. The model describes both the unpairing and unstacking parts of the spectroscopically determined experimental melting curves. Furthermore, the model explains the observed temperature dependence of the effective thermodynamic parameters used in models of the nearest neighbor type. We compute the partition function for the model through the transfer matrix formalism, which we also generalize to include nonlocal chain entropy terms.},

	Abstract = {G-Rich sequences found within biologically important regions of the genome have been shown to form intramolecular G-quadruplexes with varied loop lengths and sequences. Many of these quadruplexes will be distinguishable from each other on the basis of their thermodynamic stabilities and folded conformations. It has been proposed that loop lengths can strongly influence the topology and stability of intramolecular G-quadruplexes. Previous studies have been limited to the analysis of quadruplex sequences with particular loop sequences, making it difficult to make generalizations. Here, we describe an original study that aimed to elucidate the effect of loop length on the biophysical properties of G-quadruplexes in a sequence-independent context. We employed UV melting and circular dichroism spectroscopy to examine and compare the properties of 21 DNA quadruplex libraries, each comprising partially randomized loop sequences with lengths ranging from one to three nucleotides. Our work supports a number of general predictions that can be made solely on the basis of loop lengths. In particular, the results emphasize the strong influence of single-nucleotide loops on quadruplex properties. This study provides a predictive framework that may help identify or classify biologically relevant G-quadruplex-forming sequences.},

	Abstract = {Protein conformational switches are ubiquitous in nature and often regulate key biological processes. To design new proteins that can switch conformation, protein designers have focused on the two key components of protein switches: the amino acid sequence must be compatible with the multiple target states and there must be a mechanism for perturbing the relative stability of these states. Proteins have been designed that can switch between folded and disordered states, between distinct folded states and between different aggregation states. A variety of trigger mechanisms have been used, including pH shifts, post-translational modification and ligand binding. Recently, computational protein design methods have been applied to switch design. These include algorithms for designing novel ligand-binding sites and simultaneously optimizing a sequence for multiple target structures.},

Conformational transitions may involve conformational selection and induced fit, which can be viewed as a special case in the catalytic network. NMR, X-ray crystallography, single-molecule FRET, and simulations clearly demonstrate that the free enzyme dynamics already encompass all the conformations necessary for substrate binding, preorganization, transition-state stabilization, and product release. Conformational selection and substate population shift at each step of the catalytic turnover can accommodate enzyme specificity and efficiency. Within such a framework, entropy can have a larger role in conformational dynamics than in direct energy transfer in dynamically promoted catalysis.},

	Abstract = {Protein functional landscapes are characterized by a modest number of states compared with the folding landscapes, allowing brute force sampling of these states for smaller proteins using computer simulations. On the other hand, because the functional landscape topographies are complicated, the native state dynamics are often difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, a number of experimental and computational techniques have recently emerged that are designed to reveal the essential features of the native landscape, such as the hierarchical organization of conformational substates. These studies also shed light on the mechanisms of protein function, for example, explaining how chemical energy is transduced in molecular motors. Overall, interpreting experimental results in the light of the functional landscape paradigm considerably enhances the understanding of complex biomolecular processes.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of ligand binding coupled to conformational changes in macromolecules has recently attracted considerable interest. The 2 limiting cases are the "induced fit" mechanism (binding first) or "conformational selection" (conformational change first). Described here are the criteria by which the sequence of events can be determined quantitatively. The relative importance of the 2 pathways is determined not by comparing rate constants (a common misconception) but instead by comparing the flux through each pathway. The simple rules for calculating flux in multistep mechanisms are described and then applied to 2 examples from the literature, neither of which has previously been analyzed using the concept of flux. The first example is the mechanism of conformational change in the binding of NADPH to dihydrofolate reductase. The second example is the mechanism of flavodoxin folding coupled to binding of its cofactor, flavin mononucleotide. In both cases, the mechanism switches from being dominated by the conformational selection pathway at low ligand concentration to induced fit at high ligand concentration. Over a wide range of conditions, a significant fraction of the flux occurs through both pathways. Such a mixed mechanism likely will be discovered for many cases of coupled conformational change and ligand binding when kinetic data are analyzed by using a flux-based approach.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding mechanisms are probed experimentally using single-point mutant perturbations. The relative effects on the folding (phi-values) and unfolding (1 - phi) rates are used to infer the detailed structure of the transition-state ensemble (TSE). Here we analyze kinetic data on > 800 mutations carried out for 24 proteins with simple kinetic behavior. We find two surprising results: (i) all mutant effects are described by the equation: DeltaDeltaG(double dagger)(unfold)=0.76DeltaDeltaG(eq) +/- 1.8kJ/mol. Therefore all data are consistent with a single phi-value (0.24) with accuracy comparable to experimental precision, suggesting that the structural information in conventional phi-values is low. (ii) phi-values change with stability, increasing in mean value and spread from native to unfolding conditions, and thus cannot be interpreted without proper normalization. We eliminate stability effects calculating the phi-values at the mutant denaturation midpoints; i.e., conditions of zero stability (phi(0)). We then show that the intrinsic variability is phi(0) = 0.36 +/- 0.11, being somewhat larger for beta-sheet-rich proteins than for alpha-helical proteins. Importantly, we discover that phi(0)-values are proportional to how many of the residues surrounding the mutated site are local in sequence. High phi(0)-values correspond to protein surface sites, which have few nonlocal neighbors, whereas core residues with many tertiary interactions produce the lowest phi(0)-values. These results suggest a general mechanism in which the TSE at zero stability is a broad conformational ensemble stabilized by local interactions and without specific tertiary interactions, reconciling phi-values with many other empirical observations.},

@article{chen:10,
	Abstract = {RNA synthesis, carried out by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) in a process called transcription, involves several stages. In bacteria, transcription initiation starts with promoter recognition and binding of RNAP holoenzyme, resulting in the formation of the closed (R.P(c)) RNAP-promoter DNA complex. Subsequently, a transition to the open R.P(o) complex occurs, characterized by separation of the promoter DNA strands in an approximately 12 base-pair region to form the transcription bubble. Using coarse-grained self-organized polymer models of Thermus aquatics RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA complexes, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the R.P(c) --> R.P(o) transition. In the fast trajectories, unwinding of the promoter DNA begins by local melting around the -10 element, which is followed by sequential unzipping of DNA till the +2 site. The R.P(c) --> R.P(o) transition occurs in three steps. In step I, dsDNA melts and the nontemplate strand makes stable interactions with RNAP. In step II, DNA scrunches into RNA polymerase and the downstream base pairs sequentially open to form the transcription bubble, which results in strain build up. Subsequently, downstream dsDNA bending relieves the strain as R.P(o) forms. Entry of the dsDNA into the active-site channel of RNAP requires widening of the channel, which occurs by a swing mechanism involving transient movements of a subdomain of the beta subunit caused by steric repulsion with the DNA template strand. If premature local melting away from the -10 element occurs first then the transcription bubble formation is slow involving reformation of the opened base pairs and subsequent sequential unzipping as in the fast trajectories.},

	Abstract = {Enzymes play a key role in almost all biological processes, accelerating a variety of metabolic reactions as well as controlling energy transduction, the transcription, and translation of genetic information, and signaling. They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed effects as "coupling between conformational and chemical motions," "landscape searches" and "entropy funnels." It is shown that none of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects of enzymes, through the corresponding changes in the activation free energies.},

	Abstract = {Single molecule and NMR measurements of protein dynamics increasingly uncover the complexity of binding scenarios. Here, we describe an extended conformational selection model that embraces a repertoire of selection and adjustment processes. Induced fit can be viewed as a subset of this repertoire, whose contribution is affected by the bond types stabilizing the interaction and the differences between the interacting partners. We argue that protein segments whose dynamics are distinct from the rest of the protein ('discrete breathers') can govern conformational transitions and allosteric propagation that accompany binding processes and, as such, might be more sensitive to mutational events. Additionally, we highlight the dynamic complexity of binding scenarios as they relate to events such as aggregation and signalling, and the crowded cellular environment.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are recognized to play important roles in many biological functions such as transcription and translation regulation, cellular signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and molecular assemblies. The coupling of folding with binding through a "fly-casting" mechanism has been proposed to account for the fast binding kinetics of IDPs. In this article, experimental data from the literature were collated to verify the kinetic advantages of IDPs, while molecular simulations were performed to clarify the origin of the kinetic advantages. The phosphorylated KID-kinase-inducible domain interacting domain (KIX) complex was used as an example in the simulations. By modifying a coarse-grained model with a native-centric G{\=o}-like potential, we were able to continuously tune the degree of disorder of the phosphorylated KID domain and thus investigate the intrinsic role of chain flexibility in binding kinetics. The simulations show that the "fly-casting" effect is not only due to the greater capture radii of IDPs. The coupling of folding with binding of IDPs leads to a significant reduction in binding free-energy barrier. Such a reduction accelerates the binding process. Although the greater capture radius has been regarded as the main factor in promoting the binding rate of IDPs, we found that this parameter will also lead to the slower translational diffusion of IDPs when compared with ordered proteins. As a result, the capture rate of IDPs was found to be slower than that of ordered proteins. The main origin of the faster binding for IDPs are the fewer encounter times required before the formation of the final binding complex. The roles of the interchain native contacts fraction (Q(b)) and the mass-center distance (DeltaR) as reaction coordinates are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Biomolecular folding and function are often coupled. During molecular recognition events, one of the binding partners may transiently or partially unfold, allowing more rapid access to a binding site. We describe a simple model for this fly-casting mechanism based on the capillarity approximation and polymer chain statistics. The model shows that fly casting is most effective when the protein unfolding barrier is small and the part of the chain which extends toward the target is relatively rigid. These features are often seen in known examples of fly casting in protein-DNA binding. Simulations of protein-DNA binding based on well-funneled native-topology models with electrostatic forces confirm the trends of the analytical theory.},

	Abstract = {Identification of pathways involved in the structural transitions of biomolecular systems is often complicated by the transient nature of the conformations visited across energy barriers and the multiplicity of paths accessible in the multidimensional energy landscape. This task becomes even more challenging in exploring molecular systems on the order of megadaltons. Coarse-grained models that lend themselves to analytical solutions appear to be the only possible means of approaching such cases. Motivated by the utility of elastic network models for describing the collective dynamics of biomolecular systems and by the growing theoretical and experimental evidence in support of the intrinsic accessibility of functional substates, we introduce a new method, adaptive anisotropic network model (aANM), for exploring functional transitions. Application to bacterial chaperonin GroEL and comparisons with experimental data, results from action minimization algorithm, and previous simulations support the utility of aANM as a computationally efficient, yet physically plausible, tool for unraveling potential transition pathways sampled by large complexes/assemblies. An important outcome is the assessment of the critical inter-residue interactions formed/broken near the transition state(s), most of which involve conserved residues.},

	Abstract = {Comparison of elastic network model predictions with experimental data has provided important insights on the dominant role of the network of inter-residue contacts in defining the global dynamics of proteins. Most of these studies have focused on interpreting the mean-square fluctuations of residues, or deriving the most collective, or softest, modes of motions that are known to be insensitive to structural and energetic details. However, with increasing structural data, we are in a position to perform a more critical assessment of the structure-dynamics relations in proteins, and gain a deeper understanding of the major determinants of not only the mean-square fluctuations and lowest frequency modes, but the covariance or the cross-correlations between residue fluctuations and the shapes of higher modes. A systematic study of a large set of NMR-determined proteins is analyzed using a novel method based on entropy maximization to demonstrate that the next level of refinement in the elastic network model description of proteins ought to take into consideration properties such as contact order (or sequential separation between contacting residues) and the secondary structure types of the interacting residues, whereas the types of amino acids do not play a critical role. Most importantly, an optimal description of observed cross-correlations requires the inclusion of destabilizing, as opposed to exclusively stabilizing, interactions, stipulating the functional significance of local frustration in imparting native-like dynamics. This study provides us with a deeper understanding of the structural basis of experimentally observed behavior, and opens the way to the development of more accurate models for exploring protein dynamics.},

   engineered circularly permuted PDZ domain. This variant has the same
   sequence connectivity as naturally occurring circularly permuted PDZ
   domains and displays a symmetrical distribution of secondary structure
   elements (i.e., beta beta alpha beta beta alpha beta beta) while
   maintaining the same tertiary interactions of the well-characterized
   second PDZ domain from PTP-BL (PDZ2). Reliable Phi values were obtained
   for both a low-energy intermediate and the late rate-limiting
   transition state, allowing a description of both early and late events
   in folding. A comparison with Phi values obtained for wild-type PDZ2
   reveals that while the structure of the late transition state is robust
   and unaffected by circular permutation, the folding intermediate is
   stabilized by a different nucleus involving residues located at the new
   N- and C-termini. The results suggest that folding is driven by
   competing nuclei whose stabilities may be selectively tuned by circular
   permutation.}},

	Abstract = {Topology-based interaction potentials are simplified models that use the native contacts in the folded structure of a protein to define an energetically unfrustrated folding funnel. They have been widely used to analyze the folding transition and pathways of different proteins through computer simulations. Obviously, they need a reliable, experimentally determined folded structure to define the model interactions. In structures elucidated through NMR spectroscopy, a complex treatment of the raw experimental data usually provides a series of models, a set of different conformations compatible with the available experimental data. Here, we use an efficient coarse-grained simulation technique to independently consider the contact maps from every different NMR model in a protein whose structure has been resolved by the use of NMR spectroscopy. For lambda;-Cro repressor, a homodimeric protein, we have analyzed its folding characteristics with a topology-based model. We have focused on the competition between the folding of the individual chains and their binding to form the final quaternary structure. From 20 different NMR models, we find a predominant three-state folding behavior, in agreement with experimental data on the folding pathway for this protein. Individual NMR models, however, show distinct characteristics, which are analyzed both at the level of the interplay between tertiary/quaternary structure formation and also regarding the thermal stability of the tertiary structure of every individual chain. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {There are several important questions on the coupling between properties of the protein shape and the rate of protein folding. We have studied a series of structural descriptors intended for describing protein shapes (the radius of gyration, the radius of cross-section, and the coefficient of compactness) and their possible connection with folding behavior, either rates of folding or the emergence of folding intermediates, and compared them with classical descriptors, protein chain length and contact order. It has been found that when a descriptor is normalized to eliminate the influence of the protein size (the radius of gyration normalized to the radius of gyration of a ball of equal volume, the coefficient of compactness defined as the ratio of the accessible surface area of a protein to that of an ideal ball of equal volume, and relative contact order) it completely looses its ability to predict folding rates. On the other hand, when a descriptor correlates well with protein size (the radius of cross-section and absolute contact order in our consideration) then it correlates well with the logarithm of folding rates and separates reasonably well two-state folders from multi-state ones. The critical control for the performance of new descriptors demonstrated that the radius of cross-section has a somewhat higher predictive power (the correlation coefficient is 20.74) than size alone (the correlation coefficient is 20.65). So, we have shown that the numerical descriptors of the overall shape-geometry of protein structures are one of the important determinants of the protein-folding rate and mechanism. {\copyright} 2009 Ivankov et al.},

	Abstract = {Energy landscape theory requires that the protein-folding mechanism is generally globally directed or funneled toward the native state. The collective nature of transition state ensembles further suggests that sufficient averaging of the native interactions can occur so that the knowledge of the native topology may suffice for predicting the mechanism. Nevertheless, while simple homogeneously weighted native topology-based models predict the folding mechanisms for many proteins, for other proteins knowledge of the native topology, by itself, seems not to suffice in determining the folding mechanism. Simulations of proteins with differing topologies reveal that the failure of homogeneously weighted topology-based models can, however, be completely understood within the framework of a funneled energy landscape and can be quantified by comparing the fluctuation of entropy cost for forming contacts to the expected fluctuations in contact energy. To be precise, we find the transition state ensembles of proteins with all-α topologies, which are more uniform in the specific entropy cost of contact formation, have transition state ensembles that are more readily perturbed by differences in energetic weights than are the transition state ensembles of proteins with significant amounts of β-structure, where the specific entropy costs of contact formation are more widely distributed. This behavior is consistent with a random-field Ising model analogy that follows from the free energy functional approach to folding. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {The nucleation mechanism of protein folding, originally proposed by Baldwin in the early 1970s, was firstly observed by Shakhnovich and co-workers two decades later in the context of Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model. At about the same time the extensive use of -φvalue analysis provided the first experimental evidence that the folding of Chymotrypsin-inhibitor2, a small single-domain protein, which folds with two-state kinetics, is also driven by a nucleation mechanism. Since then, the nucleation mechanism is generally considered the most common form of folding mechanism amongst two-state proteins. However, recent experimental data has put forward the idea that this may not necessarily be so, since the accuracy of the experimentally determined φvalues, which are used to identify the critical (i.e.nucleating) residues, is typically poor. Here, we provide a survey of in silico results on the nucleation mechanism, ranging from simple lattice Monte Carlo to more sophisticated off-lattice molecular dynamics simulations, and discuss them in light of experimental data. {\copyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Exploring the landscape of large scale conformational changes such as protein folding at atomistic detail poses a considerable computational challenge. Coarse-grained representations of the peptide chain have therefore been developed and over the last decade have proved extremely valuable. These include topology-based Go models, which constitute a smooth and funnel-like approximation to the folding landscape. We review the many variations of the Go model that have been employed to yield insight into folding mechanisms. Their success has been interpreted as a consequence of the dominant role of the native topology in folding. The role of local contact density in determining protein dynamics is also discussed and is used to explain the ability of Go-like models to capture sequence effects in folding and elucidate conformational transitions.},

	Abstract = {WW domains are the smallest naturally independent β-sheet protein structures available to date and constitute attractive model systems for investigating the determinants of β-sheet folding and stability. Nonetheless, their small size and low cooperativity pose a difficult challenge for a quantitative analysis of the folding equilibrium. We describe here a comprehensive thermodynamic characterization of the conformational equilibrium of the fourth WW domain from the human ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (hNedd4-WW4) using a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques with several denaturing agents (temperature, pH, and chemical denaturants). Our results reveal that even though the experimental data can be described in terms of a two-state equilibrium, spectral data together with anomalous values for some thermodynamic parameters (a strikingly low temperature of maximum stability, a higher than expected native-state heat capacity, and a small specific enthalpy of unfolding) could be indicative of more complex types of equilibria, such as one-state downhill folding or alternative native conformations. Moreover, double-perturbation experiments reveal some features that, in spite of the apparent linear correlation between the thermodynamic parameters, seem to be indicative of a complex conformational equilibriumin the presence of urea. In summary, the data presented here point toward the existence of a low-energy barrier between the different macrostates of hNedd4-WW4, placing it at the frontier of cooperative folding. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {Terminal deletions of units from a-helical repeat proteins have provided insight into the physical origins of their cooperativity. To test if the same principles governing cooperativity apply to β-sheet-containing repeat proteins, we have created a series of C-terminal deletion constructs from a large leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, YopM. We have examined the structure and stability of the resulting deletion constructs by a combination of solution spectroscopy, equilibrium denaturation studies, and limited proteolysis. Surprisingly, a high degree of nonuniformity was found in the stability distribution of YopM. Unlike previously studied repeat proteins, we identified several key LRR that on deletion disrupt nearby structure, at distances as far away as up to three repeats, in YopM. This partial unfolding model is supported by limited proteolysis studies and by point substitution in repeats predicted to be disordered as a result of deletion of adjacent repeats. We show that key internal- and terminal-caps must be present to maintain the structural integrity in adjacent regions (roughly four LRRs long) of decreased stability. The finding that full-length YopM maintains a high level of cooperativity in equilibrium unfolding underscores the importance of interfacial interactions in stabilizing locally unstable regions of structure. {\copyright} 2009 The Protein Society.},

	Abstract = {The folding cooperativity is an important issue of protein folding dynamics. Since the native topology plays a significant role in determining the folding behavior of proteins, we believe that it also has close relationship with the folding cooperativity. In the present work, we perform simulations on proteins Naf-BBL, QNND-BBL, CI2, and SH3 with the G model and compare their different folding behaviors. By analyzing the weak cooperative folding of protein Naf-BBL in detail, we found that the folding of Naf-BBL shows relatively weak thermodynamic coupling between residues, and such weak coupling is found mainly between the nonlocal native contacts. This finding complements our understandings on the source of barrierless folding of Naf-BBL and promotes us to analyze the topological origins of the poor thermodynamic coupling of Naf-BBL. Then, we further extend our analysis to other two-state and multistate proteins. Based on the considerations of the thermodynamic coupling and kinetic coupling, we conclude that the fraction of scattered native contacts, the difference in loop entropy of contacts, and the long range relative contact order are the major topological factors that influence the folding cooperativity. The combination of these three tertiary structural features shows significant correlations with the folding types of proteins. Moreover, we also discuss the topological factors related to downhill folding. Finally, the generic role of tertiary structure in determining the folding cooperativity is summarized. {\copyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The eukaryotic signaling protein calmodulin (CaM) can bind to more than 300 known target proteins to regulate numerous functions in our body in a calcium-dependent manner. How CaM distinguishes between these various targets is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate fluctuations of the complex formation of CaM and its target peptide sequences using single-molecule force spectroscopy by AFM. By applying mechanical force, we can steer a single CaM molecule through its folding energy landscape from the fully unfolded state to the native target-bound state revealing equilibrium fluctuations between numerous intermediate states. We find that the prototypical CaM target sequence skMLCK, a fragment from skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, binds to CaM in a highly cooperative way, while only a lower degree of interdomain binding cooperativity emerges for CaMKK, a target peptide from CaM-dependent kinase kinase. We identify minimal binding motifs for both of these peptides, confirming that affinities of target peptides are not exclusively determined by their pattern of hydrophobic anchor residues. Our results reveal an association mode for CaMKK in which the peptide binds strongly to only partially Ca 2+-saturated CaM. This binding mode might allow for a fine-tuning of the intracellular response to changes in Ca2+ concentration.},

	Abstract = {Multimeric proteins are ubiquitous in many cellular processes that require high levels of regulation. Eukaryotic gene expression is often regulated by a mechanism of combinatorial control that involves the binding of dimeric transcription factors to DNA together with the coordinated activity of additional proteins. In this study, we investigated the dimerization of the Arc-repressor on DNA with the aim of achieving microscopic insight into the possible advantages of interacting with DNA as a complex rather than as a monomeric single-domain protein. We used a computational coarse-grained model in which the protein dynamics was governed by native interactions and protein-DNA interactions were dictated by electrostatic forces. Inspired by previous experimental work that showed an enhanced refolding rate for the Arc-repressor in the presence of DNA and other polyanions, we focused on the mechanism and kinetics of the assembly of Arc monomers in the presence of single-(ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules in a low-salt concentration environment. The electrostatic interactions that attract the protein to the dsDNA were shown to be fundamental in colocalizing the unfolded Arc chains and in accelerating refolding. Arc monomers bind the dsDNA efficiently and nonspecifically, and search for each other via one-dimensional diffusion. The fastest folding of Arc is observed for DNA of 30 bp. Longer DNA is significantly less efficient in accelerating the Arc refolding rate, since the two subunits search distinct regions of the one-dimensional DNA and are therefore much less colocalized. The probability that the two unfolded chains will meet on 200 bp DNA is similar to that in the bulk. The colocalization of Arc subunits on ssDNA results in much faster folding compared to that obtained on dsDNA of the same length. Differences in the rate of Arc refolding, cooperativity, and the structure of its transition state ensemble introduced by ssDNA and dsDNA molecules demonstrate the important role of colocalization in biological self-assembly processes. {\copyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {A generic coarse-grained (CG) protein model is presented. The intermediate level of resolution (four beads per amino acid, implicit solvent) allows for accurate sampling of local conformations. It relies on simple interactions that emphasize structure, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity. Realistic α/Β content is achieved by including an effective nearest-neighbor dipolar interaction. Parameters are tuned to reproduce both local conformations and tertiary structures. The thermodynamics and kinetics of a three-helix bundle are studied. We check that the CG model is able to fold proteins with tertiary structures and amino acid sequences different from the one used for parameter tuning. By studying both helical and extended conformations we make sure the force field is not biased toward any particular secondary structure. The accuracy involved in folding not only the test protein but also other ones show strong evidence for amino acid cooperativity embedded in the model. Without any further adjustments or bias a realistic oligopeptide aggregation scenario is observed. {\copyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The variation in folding rate among single-domain natural proteins is tremendous, but common models with explicit representations of the protein chain are either demonstrably insufficient or unclear as to their capability for rationalizing the experimental diversity in folding rates. In view of the critical role of water exclusion in cooperative folding, we apply native-centric, coarse-grained chain modeling with elementary desolvation barriers to investigate solvation effects on folding rates. For a set of 13 proteins, folding rates simulated with desolvation barriers cover ∼ 4.6 orders of magnitude, spanning a range essentially identical to that observed experimentally. In contrast, folding rates simulated without desolvation barriers cover only ∼ 2.2 orders of magnitude. Following a Hammond-like trend, the folding transition-state ensemble (TSE) of a protein model with desolvation barriers generally has a higher average number of native contacts and is structurally more specific, that is, less diffused, than the TSE of the corresponding model without desolvation barriers. Folding is generally significantly slower in models with desolvation barriers because of their higher overall macroscopic folding barriers as well as slower conformational diffusion speeds in the TSE that are ≈ 1/50 times those in models without desolvation barriers. Nonetheless, the average root-mean-square deviation between the TSE and the native conformation is often similar in the two modeling approaches, a finding suggestive of a more robust structural requirement for the folding rate-limiting step. The increased folding rate diversity in models with desolvation barriers originates from the tendency of these microscopic barriers to cause more heightening of the overall macroscopic folding free-energy barriers for proteins with more nonlocal native contacts than those with fewer such contacts. Thus, the enhancement of folding cooperativity by solvation effects is seen as positively correlated with a protein's native topological complexity. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Evolutionary conservation of substructure architecture between yeast iso-1-cytochrome c and the well-characterized horse cytochrome c is studied with limited proteolysis, the alkaline conformational transition and global unfolding with guanidine-HCl. Mass spectral analysis of limited proteolysis cleavage products for iso-1-cytochrome c show that its least stable substructure is the same as horse cytochrome c. The limited proteolysis data yield a free energy of 3.8 $\pm$ 0.4 kcal mol-1 to unfold the least stable substructure compared with 5.05 $\pm$ 0.30 kcal mol-1 for global unfolding of iso-1-cytochrome c. Thus, substructure stabilities of iso-1-cytochrome c span only ∼1.2 kcal mol-1 compared with ∼8 kcal mol-1 for horse cytochrome c. Consistent with the less cooperative folding thus expected for the horse protein, the guanidine-HCl m-values are ∼3 kcal mol-1 M-1 versus ∼4.5 kcal mol-1M-1 for horse versus yeast cytochrome c. The tight free energy spacing of the yeast cytochrome c substructures suggests that its folding has more branch points than for horse cytochrome c. Studies on a variant of iso-1-cytochrome c with an H26N mutation indicate that the least and most stable substructures unfold sequentially and the two least stable substructures unfold independently as for horse cytochrome c. Thus, important aspects of the substructure architecture of horse cytochrome c, albeit compressed energetically, are preserved evolutionally in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. {\copyright} 2009 The Protein Society.},

	Abstract = {Small proteins with globular structures often fold by simple all-or-none mechanisms, both in an equilibrium and a kinetic sense, despite the very large number of partly folded conformations available. This type of 'two-state' folding will be discussed in terms of experimental tests, underlying molecular mechanisms, and limits to two-state behavior. Factors that appear to be important for two-state folding include topology (sequence distance of contacts in the native structure), molecular cooperativity and local energy distribution. Because their local stability distributions and cooperativities can be dissected and analyzed separately from topological features, recent studies of the folding of symmetric proteins will be discussed as a means to better understand the origins of two-state folding. {\copyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Theory of multidimensional representation of free energy surface of protein folding is developed by adopting structural order parameters of multiple regions in protein as multiple coordinates. Various scenarios of folding are classified in terms of cooperativity within individual regions and interactions among multiple regions and thus obtained classification is used to analyze the folding process of several example proteins. Ribosomal protein S6, src-SH3 domain, CheY, barnase, and BBL domain are analyzed with the two-dimensional representation by using a structure-based Hamiltonian model. The extension to the higher dimensional representation leads to the finer description of the folding process. Barnase, NtrC, and an ankyrin repeat protein are examined with the three-dimensional representation. The multidimensional representation allows us to directly address questions on folding pathways, intermediates, and transition states. {\copyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {We present a theory for protein folding stability and cooperativity for helix bundle proteins. We treat the individual helices with a Schellman-Zimm-Bragg-like approach, using nucleation and propagation quantities, and we treat the hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts between the helices as a binding equilibrium. Predictions are in good agreement with experiments on both thermal and urea-induced transitions of (1) molecules that can undergo single helix-to-coil transitions for various chain lengths and (2) three-helix-bundle proteins A and α3C. The present model addresses a problem raised by Kaya and Chan that proteins fold more cooperatively than previous models predict. The present model correctly predicts the experimentally observed two-state cooperativities, ΔHvan't Hoff/ΔH cal 1, for helix-bundle proteins. The predicted folding cooperativity is greater than that of helix formation alone, or collapse alone, because of the nonlinear coupling between the tertiary interactions and the helical interactions. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {Many single-domain proteins with <100 residues fold cooperatively; but the recently designed 92-residue Top7 protein exhibits clearly non-two-state behaviors. In apparent agreement with experiment, we found that coarse-grained, native-centric chain models, including potentials with and without elementary desolvation barriers, predicted that Top7 has a stable intermediate state in which the C-terminal fragment is folded while the rest of the chain remains disordered. We observed noncooperative folding in Top7 models that incorporated nonnative hydrophobic interactions as well. In contrast, free energy profiles deduced from models with desolvation barriers for a set of thirteen natural proteins with similar chain lengths and secondary structure elements suggested that they fold much more cooperatively than Top7. Buttressed by related studies on smaller natural proteins with chain lengths of ∼40 residues, our findings argue that the de novo native topology of Top7 likely imposed a significant restriction on the cooperativity achievable by any design for this target structure. {\copyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {Studies on members of protein families with similar structures but divergent sequences provide insights into the effects of sequence composition on the mechanism of folding. Members of the peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD) family fold ultrafast and approach the smallest size for cooperatively folding proteins. Phi-Value analysis of the PSBDs E3BD and POB reveals folding via nucleation-condensation through structurally very similar, polarized transition states. Here, we present a Phi-value analysis of the family member BBL and found that it also folds by a nucleation-condensation mechanism. The mean Phi values of BBL, E3BD, and POB were near identical, indicating similar fractions of non-covalent interactions being formed in the transition state. Despite the overall conservation of folding mechanism in this protein family, however, the pattern of Phi values determined for BBL revealed a larger dispersion of the folding nucleus across the entire structure, and the transition state was less polarized. The observed plasticity of transition-state structure can be rationalized by the different helix-forming propensities of PSBD sequences. The very strong helix propensity in the first helix of BBL, relative to E3BD and POB, appears to recruit more structure formation in that helix in the transition state at the expense of weaker interactions in the second helix. Differences in sequence composition can modulate transition-state structure of even the smallest natural protein domains.},

	Abstract = {Transition paths are a uniquely single-molecule property not yet observed for any molecular process in solution. The duration of transition paths is the tiny fraction of the time in an equilibrium single-molecule trajectory when the process actually happens. Here, we report the determination of an upper bound for the transition path time for protein folding from photon-by-photon trajectories. FRET trajectories were measured on single molecules of the dye-labeled, 56-residue 2-state protein GB1, immobilized on a glass surface via a biotin-streptavidin-biotin linkage. Characterization of individual emitted photons by their wavelength, polarization, and absolute and relative time of arrival after picosecond excitation allowed the determination of distributions of FRET efficiencies, donor and acceptor lifetimes, steady state polarizations, and waiting times in the folded and unfolded states. Comparison with the results for freely diffusing molecules showed that immobilization has no detectable effect on the structure or dynamics of the unfolded protein and only a small effect on the folding/unfolding kinetics. Analysis of the photon-by-photon trajectories yields a transition path time <200 micros, >10,000 times shorter than the mean waiting time in the unfolded state (the inverse of the folding rate coefficient). Szabo's theory for diffusive transition paths shows that this upper bound for the transition path time is consistent with previous estimates of the Kramers preexponential factor for the rate coefficient, and predicts that the transition path time is remarkably insensitive to the folding rate, with only a 2-fold difference for rate coefficients that differ by 10(5)-fold.},

	Abstract = {An intriguing feature of protein folding is that the overall behavior obeys simple physical rules, but the finer details show a great deal of complexity. The scaling of thermodynamic and kinetic properties with protein size is one such rule. However, it is not clear to what extent biologically relevant folding properties (i.e., rates and stabilities) depend on size and/or on other factors such as structure and amino acid sequence. Here we address this question analyzing experimental data on 52 nonmultistate folding proteins with a simple theoretical model. We find that size scaling is the primary factor in determining folding rates, and more surprisingly also protein stability. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the experimental deviations from size predictions are due to minute differences in the fundamental parameters (e.g., less than 2\% for the stability). Folding is thus highly sensitive to little changes in protein energetics, but at the same time the folding properties of natural proteins are remarkably homogeneous. These results suggest that evolution has selected a small subset of possibilities from the physically plausible folding catalog and highlight the need for highly accurate protein force fields to predict rates and stabilities beyond general trends.},

	Abstract = {An extensive set of equilibrium and kinetic data is presented and analyzed for an ultrafast folding protein--the villin subdomain. The equilibrium data consist of the excess heat capacity, tryptophan fluorescence quantum yield, and natural circular-dichroism spectrum as a function of temperature, and the kinetic data consist of time courses of the quantum yield from nanosecond-laser temperature-jump experiments. The data are well fit with three kinds of models--a three-state chemical-kinetics model, a physical-kinetics model, and an Ising-like theoretical model that considers 10(5) possible conformations (microstates). In both the physical-kinetics and theoretical models, folding is described as diffusion on a one-dimensional free-energy surface. In the physical-kinetics model the reaction coordinate is unspecified, whereas in the theoretical model, order parameters, either the fraction of native contacts or the number of native residues, are used as reaction coordinates. The validity of these two reaction coordinates is demonstrated from calculation of the splitting probability from the rate matrix of the master equation for all 10(5) microstates. The analysis of the data on site-directed mutants using the chemical-kinetics model provides information on the structure of the transition-state ensemble; the physical-kinetics model allows an estimate of the height of the free-energy barrier separating the folded and unfolded states; and the theoretical model provides a detailed picture of the free-energy surface and a residue-by-residue description of the evolution of the folded structure, yet contains many fewer adjustable parameters than either the chemical- or physical-kinetics models.},

	Abstract = {Folding of many single-domain proteins has been described using the nucleation-collapse (NC) mechanism. According to NC, folding (formation of secondary structures and tertiary interactions) and chain collapse occur synchronously upon formation of native-like structures involving a critical number of residues. Using simple nucleation theory together with structure-based thermodynamic data, the average size of the most probable nucleus N R ( *), for single-domain proteins, is estimated to be between 15 and 30 residues. We argue that finite-sized fluctuations in this estimate can be large so that nearly half of the residues of a 100 residue protein can be part of the folding nucleus. Inclusion of surface area changes in the folded and unfolded states are important in the determination of N R ( *).},

(c) Can we predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence? Once regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen great progress in recent years. Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the structures of the major folding transition states of nine proteins by correlation of published Φ-values with inter-residue contact maps. Combined with previous studies on six proteins, the analysis suggests that at least 10 of the 15 small globular proteins fold via a nucleation-condensation mechanism with a concurrent build-up of secondary and tertiary structure contacts, but a structural consolidation that is clearly nonuniformly distributed over the molecule and most intense in a single structural region suggesting the occurrence of a single folding nucleus. However, on average helix- and sheet-forming residues show somewhat larger Φ-values in the major transition state, suggesting that secondary structure formation is one important driving force in the nucleation-condensation in many proteins and that secondary-structure forming residues tend to be more prominent in folding nuclei. We synthesize the combined information on these 10 of 15 proteins into a unified nucleation-condensation mechanism which also accounts for effects described by the framework, hydrophobic collapse, zipper, and funnel models. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{badasyan:08,
	Abstract = {Experiments point to appreciable variations in folding cooperativity among natural proteins with approximately 40 residues, indicating that the behaviors of these proteins are valuable for delineating the contributing factors to cooperative folding. To explore the role of native topology in a protein's propensity to fold cooperatively and how native topology might constrain the degree of cooperativity achievable by a given set of physical interactions, we compared folding/unfolding kinetics simulated using three classes of native-centric Cα chain models with different interaction schemes. The approach was applied to two homologous 45-residue fragments from the peripheral subunit-binding domain family and a 39-residue fragment of the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L9. Free-energy profiles as functions of native contact number were computed to assess the heights of thermodynamic barriers to folding. In addition, chevron plots of folding/unfolding rates were constructed as functions of native stability to facilitate comparison with available experimental data. Although common G{\=o}-like models with pairwise Lennard-Jones-type interactions generally fold less cooperatively than real proteins, the rank ordering of cooperativity predicted by these models is consistent with experiment for the proteins investigated, showing increasing folding cooperativity with increasing nonlocality of a protein's native contacts. Models that account for water-expulsion (desolvation) barriers and models with many-body (nonadditive) interactions generally entail higher degrees of folding cooperativity indicated by more linear model chevron plots, but the rank ordering of cooperativity remains unchanged. A robust, experimentally valid rank ordering of model folding cooperativity independent of the multiple native-centric interaction schemes tested here argues that native topology places significant constraints on how cooperatively a protein can fold. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{kloss:08a,
	Abstract = {Small globular proteins have many contacts between residues that are distant in primary sequence. These contacts create a complex network between sequence-distant segments of secondary structure, which may be expected to promote the cooperative folding of globular proteins. Although repeat proteins, which are composed of tandem modular units, lack sequence-distant contacts, several of considerable length have been shown to undergo cooperative two-state folding. To explore the limits of cooperativity in repeat proteins, we have studied the unfolding of YopM, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein of over 400 residues. Despite its large size and modular architecture (15 repeats), YopM equilibrium unfolding is highly cooperative, and shows a very strong dependence on the concentration of urea. In contrast, kinetic studies of YopM folding indicate a mechanism that includes one or more transient intermediates. The urea dependence of the folding and unfolding rates suggests a relatively small transition state ensemble. As with the urea dependence, we have found an extreme dependence of the free energy of unfolding on the concentration of salt. This salt dependence likely results from general screening of a large number of unfavorable columbic interactions in the folded state, rather than from specific cation binding. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{haglund:08,
	Abstract = {The evolved properties of proteins are not limited to structure and stability but also include their propensity to undergo local conformational changes. The latter, dynamic property is related to structural cooperativity and is controlled by the folding-energy landscape. Here we demonstrate that the structural cooperativity of the ribosomal protein S6 is optimized by geometric overlap of two competing folding nuclei: they both include the central β-strand 1. In this way, folding of one nucleus catalyzes the formation of the other, contributing to make the folding transition more concerted overall. The experimental evidence is provided by an extended set of circular permutations of S6 that allows quantitative analysis of pathway plasticity at the level of individual side chains. Because similar overlap between competing nuclei also has been discerned in other proteins, we hypothesize that the coupling of several small nuclei into extended "supernuclei" represents a general principle for propagating folding cooperativity across large structural distances. {\copyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Multidomain proteins are ubiquitous in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes. Study on protein folding, however, has concentrated more on the isolated single domains of proteins, and there have been relatively few systematic studies on the effects of domain-domain interactions on folding. We here discuss this issue by examining human γD-crystallin, spore coat protein S, and a tandem array of the R16 and R17 domains of spectrin as example proteins by using a structure-based model of folding. The calculated results consistently explain the experimental data on folding pathways and effects of mutational perturbations, supporting the view that the connectivity of two domains and the distribution of domain-domain interactions in the native conformation are factors to determine kinetic and equilibrium properties of cooperative folding. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {Downhill folding is one of the most impor tant predictions of energy landscape theory. Recently, the Escherichia coli 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase PSBD was described as a first example of global downhill folding (Garcia- Mira et al., Science 2002;298:2191), classi fication that has been later subject of sig nificant controversy. To help resolve this problem, by using intensive all-atom simu lation with explicit water model and the replica exchange method, we sample the phase space of protein BBL and depict the free energy landscape. We give an estimate of the free energy barrier height of 1-2 kBT, dependent on the way the energy landscape is projected. We also study the conformational distribution of the transi tion region and find that the three helices generally take the similar positions as that in the native states whereas their spatial orientations show large variability. We fur ther detect the inconsistency between dif ferent signals by individually fitting the thermal denaturation curves of five struc tural features using two-state model, which gives a wide spread melting temperature of 19 K. All of these features are consistent with a picture of folding with very low cooperativities. Compared with the experi mental data (Sadqi et al., Nature 2006; 442:317), our results indicate that the Naf- BBL (pH5.3) may have an even lower bar rier height and cooperativity. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {The {\=G}-like potential at a residual level has been successfully applied to the folding of proteins in many previous works. However, taking into consideration more detailed structural information in the atomic level, the definition of contacts used in these traditional G-models may not be suitable for all-atom simulations. Here, in this work, we develop a rational definition of contacts considering the screening effect in the crowded intramolecular environment. In such a scheme, a large amount of screened atom pairs are excluded and the number of contacts is decreased compared to the case of the traditional definition. These contacts defined by such a new definition are compatible with the all-atom representation of protein structures. To verify the rationality of the new definition of contacts, the folding of proteins CI2 and SH3 is simulated by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. A high folding cooperativity and good correlation of the simulated -values with those obtained experimentally, especially for CI2, are found. This suggests that the all-atom G-model is improved compared to the traditional G-model. Based on the comparison of the -values, the roles of side chains in the folding are discussed, and it is concluded that the side-chain structures are more important for local contacts in determining the transition state structures. Moreover, the relations between side chain and backbone orderings are also discussed. {\copyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The energetic contribution of complex salt bridges, in which one charged residue (anchor residue) forms salt bridges with two or more residues simultaneously, has been suggested to have importance for protein stability. Detailed analysis of the net energetics of complex salt bridge formation using double-and triple-mutant cycle analysis revealed conflicting results. In two cases, it was shown that complex salt bridge formation is cooperative, i.e., the net strength of the complex salt bridge is more than the sum of the energies of individual pairs. In one case, it was reported that complex salt bridge formation is anticooperative. To resolve these different findings, we performed analysis of the geometries of salt bridges in a representative set of structures from the PDB and found that over 87% of all complex salt bridges anchored by Arg/Lys have a geometry such that the angle formed by their Cα atoms, Θ, is <90$\,^{\circ}$. This preferred geometry is observed in the two reported instances when the energetics of complex salt bridge formation is cooperative, while in the reported anti-cooperative complex salt bridge, Θ is close to 160$\,^{\circ}$. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that complex salt bridges are cooperative for Θ < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and anti-cooperative for 90$\,^{\circ}$ < Θ < 180$\,^{\circ}$. To provide a further experimental test for this hypothesis, we engineered a complex salt bridge with Θ = 150$\,^{\circ}$ into a model protein, the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2 (ADA2h). Experimentally derived stabilities of the ADA2h variants allowed us to show that the complex salt bridge in ADA2h is anti-cooperative. Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

	Abstract = {Cooperativity is an emergent many-body phenomenon related to the degree to which elementary entities (particles, molecules, organisms) collectively interact to form larger scale structures. From the standpoint of a formal mean field description of chemical reactions, the cooperativity index m, describing the number of elements involved in this structural self-organization, is the order of the reaction. Thus, m for molecular self-assembly is the number of molecules in the final organized structure, e.g., spherical micelles. Although cooperativity is crucial for regulating the thermodynamics and dynamics of self-assembly, there is a limited understanding of this aspect of self-assembly. We analyze the cooperativity by calculating essential thermodynamic properties of the classical mth order reaction model of self-assembly (FAm model), including universal scaling functions describing the temperature and concentration dependence of the order parameter and average cluster size. The competition between self-assembly and phase separation is also described. We demonstrate that a sequential model of thermally activated equilibrium polymerization can quantitatively be related to the FAm model. Our analysis indicates that the essential requirement for "cooperative" self-assembly is the introduction of constraints (often nonlocal) acting on the individual assembly events to regulate the thermodynamic free energy landscape and, thus, the thermodynamic sharpness of the assembly transition. An effective value of m is defined for general self-assembly transitions, and we find a general tendency for self-assembly to become a true phase transition as m→∞. Finally, various quantitative measures of self-assembly cooperativity are discussed in order to identify experimental signatures of cooperativity in self-assembling systems and to provide a reliable metric for the degree of transition cooperativity. {\copyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {One of the predictions of the energy landscape theory of protein folding is the possibility of barrierless, "downhill" folding under certain conditions. The protein 1BBL has been proposed to fold by such a downhill mechanism, though this is a matter of some dispute. We carried out extensive replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on 1BBL in explicit solvent to address this controversy and provide a microscopic picture of its folding thermodynamics. Our simulations show two distinct structural transitions in the folding of 1BBL. A low-temperature transition involves a disordering of the protein's tertiary structure without loss of secondary structure. A distinct, higher temperature transition involves the complete loss of secondary structure and dissolution of the hydrophobic core. In contrast, control simulations of the 1BBL homolog E3BD show a single high temperature unfolding transition. Further simulations of 1BBL at high ionic strength show a significant destabilization of helix II but not helix I, suggesting that the apparent folding cooperativity of 1BBL may be highly dependent on experimental conditions. Although our simulations cannot provide definitive evidence of downhill folding in 1BBL, they clearly show evidence of a complex, non-two-state folding process. {\copyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {Chaperonins are multi-subunit complexes that enhance the efficiency of protein-folding reactions by capturing protein substrates in their central cavities. They occur in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types and, alone amongst molecular chaperones, chaperonin knockouts are always lethal. Chaperonins come in two forms; the Group I are found in bacteria, mitochondria and plastids [W.A. Fenton, A.L. Horwich, Q. Rev. Biophys. 36 (2003) 229-256, [1]] and the Group II in the eukaryotic cytoplasm and in archaea [N.J. Cowan, S.A. Lewis, Adv. Protein Chem. 59 (2001) 73-104, [2]]. Both use energy derived from ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive a series of structural rearrangements that enable them to capture, engulf and then release polypeptide chains that have either not yet acquired the native, biologically active state or have been denatured in the cell. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {To determine whether a protein folding reaction can occur in the absence of a dominant barrier is crucial for understanding its complexity. Here direct ultrafast kinetic measurements have been used to study the initial submillisecond (sub-ms) folding reaction of the small protein barstar. The cooperativity of the initial folding reaction has been explored by using two probes: fluorescence resonance energy transfer, through which the contraction of two intramolecular distances is measured, and the binding of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, through which the formation of hydrophobic clusters is monitored. A fast chain contraction is shown to precede the formation of hydrophobic clusters, indicating that the sub-ms folding reaction is not cooperative. The observed rate constant of the sub-ms folding reaction monitored by 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence has been found to be the same in stabilizing conditions (low urea concentrations), in which specific structure is formed, and in marginally stabilizing conditions (higher urea concentrations), where virtually no structure is formed in the product of the sub-ms folding reaction. The observation that the folding rate is independent of the folding conditions suggests that the initial folding reaction occurs in the absence of a dominant free energy barrier. These results provide kinetic evidence that the formation of specific structure need not be slowed down by any significant free energy barrier during the course of a very fast protein folding reaction. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {The SH3 domain has often been used as a model for protein folding due to its typical two-state behaviour. However, recent experimental data at low pH as well as molecular dynamic simulations have indicated that the folding process of SH3 probably is more complicated, and may involve intermediate states. Using both kinetic and equilibrium measurements we have obtained evidence that under native-like conditions the folding of the spectrin SH3 domain does not follow a classic two-state behaviour. The curvature we observed in the Chevron plots is a strong indication of a non-linear activation energy relationship due to the presence of high-energy intermediates. In addition, circular dichroism measurements indicated that refolding after thermal denaturation did not follow the same pattern as thermal unfolding but rather implied less cooperativity and that the refolding transition increased with increasing protein concentration. Further, NMR experiments indicated that upon refolding the SH3 domain gave rise to more than one conformation. Therefore, our results suggest that the folding of the SH3 domain of αII-spectrin does not follow a classical two-state process under high-salt conditions and neutral pH. Heterogeneous folding pathways, which can include folding intermediates as well as misfolded intermediates, might give a more reasonable insight into the folding behaviour of the αII-spectrin SH3 domain. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Accurate description of the solvent environment is critical in computer simulations of protein structure and dynamics. An implicit treatment of solvent aims to capture the mean influence of water molecules on the solute via direct estimation of the solvation free energy. It has emerged as a powerful alternative to explicit solvent, and provides a favorable compromise between computational cost and level of detail. We review the current theory and techniques for implicit modeling of nonpolar solvation in the context of simulating protein folding and conformational transitions, and discuss the main directions for further development. It is demonstrated that the current surface area based nonpolar models have severe limitations, including insufficient description of the conformational dependence of solvation, over-estimation of the strength of pair-wise nonpolar interactions, and incorrect prediction of anti-cooperativity for three-body hydrophobic associations. We argue that, to improve beyond current level of accuracy of implicit solvent models, two important aspects of nonpolar solvation need to be incorporated, namely, the length-scale dependence of hydrophobic association and solvent screening of solute-solute dispersion interactions. We recognize that substantial challenges exist in constructing a sufficiently balanced, yet reasonably efficient, implicit solvent protein force field. Nonetheless, most of the fundamental problems are understood, and exciting progress has been made over the last few years. We believe that continual work along the frontiers outlined will greatly improve one's ability to study protein folding and large conformational transitions at atomistic detail. {\copyright} the Owner Societies.},

	Abstract = {Repeat-proteins are made up of near repetitions of 20- to 40-amino acid stretches. These polypeptides usually fold up into non-globular, elongated architectures that are stabilized by the interactions within each repeat and those between adjacent repeats, but that lack contacts between residues distant in sequence. The inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that may be analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete "domain" (the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (ΔGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not ordinarily apply for globular proteins. We show how the parameters for the "coarse-grained" description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate the ideas, we present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. Based on the dramatic effect that single point mutations exert on the experimentally observed folding behavior, we speculate that natural repeat proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions. {\copyright} 2008 Ferreiro et al.},

	Abstract = {Domains are the structural, functional, and evolutionary components of proteins. Most folding studies to date have concentrated on the folding of single domains, but more than 70% of human proteins contain more than one domain, and interdomain interactions can affect both the stability and the folding kinetics. Whether the folding pathway is altered by interdomain interactions is not yet known. Here we investigated the effect of a folded neighbouring domain on the folding pathway of spectrin R16 (the 16th α-helical repeat from chicken brain α-spectrin) by using the two-domain construct R1516. The R16 folds faster and unfolds more slowly in the presence of its folded neighbour R15 (the 15th α-helical repeat from chicken brain α-spectrin). An extensive Φ-value analysis of the R16 domain in R1516 was completed to compare the transition state of the R16 domain alone with that of the R16 domain in a multidomain construct. The results indicate that the folding pathways are the same. This result validates the current approach of breaking up larger proteins into domains for the study of protein folding pathways. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In an attempt to determine how the folding dynamics of multistranded β-sheets vary with the strand number, we have studied the temperature-induced relaxation kinetics of a four-stranded β-sheet, DPDPDP. Our results show that the thermally induced relaxation of DPDPDP occurs on the nanosecond time scale; however, a comparison of the current results with those obtained on a sequence-related, three-stranded β-sheet suggests that increasing the strand number from three to four increases the folding free energy barrier by a minimum of 0.8 kcal/mol, depending on the folding mechanism. Therefore, these results together suggest that the relaxation kinetics of DPDPDP can be analyzed according to a two-state model even though its folding may actually involve parallel (but degenerate or nearly degenerate) kinetic pathways. The apparent, two-state folding time of DPDPDP is determined to be ∼0.44 μs at the thermal melting temperature, which makes it one of the fastest folders known to date. {\copyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

We illustrate the success of the new protein model in capturing thermodynamic measures and folding mechanism of proteins L and G. Compared to our previous coarse-grained model, the new model shows greater folding cooperativity and improvements in designability of protein sequences, as well as predicting correct trends for kinetic rates and mechanism for proteins L and G. We believe the model is broadly applicable to other protein folding and protein-protein co-assembly processes, and does not require experimental input beyond the topology description of the native state. Even without tertiary topology information, it can also serve as a mid-resolution protein model for more exhaustive conformational search strategies that can bridge back down to atomic descriptions of the polypeptide chain. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Additivity principles in chemistry, biochemistry, and biophysics have been used extensively for decades. Nevertheless, it is well known that additivity frequently breaks down in complex biomacromolecules. Nonadditivity within protein double mutant free energy cycles of spatially close residue pairs is a generally well-understood phenomenon, whereas a robust description of nonadditivity extending over large distances remains to be developed. Here, we test the hypothesis that the mutational effects tend to be nonadditive if two structurally well-separated mutated residues belong to the same rigid cluster within the wild type protein, and additive if they are located within different clusters. We find the hypothesis to be statistically significant with P-values that range from 10-5 to 10-6. To the best of our knowledge, this result represents the first demonstration of a statistically significant preponderance for nonadditivity over long distances. These findings provide new insight into the origins of long-range nonadditivity in double mutant cycles, which complements the conventional wisdom that nonadditivity arises in double mutations involving contacting residues. Consequently, these results should have far-reaching implications for a proper understanding of protein stability, structure/function analyses, and protein design. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In order to make this model more appropriate for comparison with protein folding simulations and experiments, we introduce a many-body interaction into the potential term to enhance cooperativity.

	Abstract = {Although our understanding of globular protein folding continues to advance, the irregular tertiary structures and high cooperativity of globular proteins complicates energetic dissection. Recently, proteins with regular, repetitive tertiary structures have been identified that sidestep limitations imposed by globular protein architecture. Here we review recent studies of repeat-protein folding. These studies uniquely advance our understanding of both the energetics and kinetics of protein folding. Equilibrium studies provide detailed maps of local stabilities, access to energy landscapes, insights into cooperativity, determination of nearest-neighbor interaction parameters using statistical thermodynamics, relationships between consensus sequences and repeat-protein stability. Kinetic studies provide insight into the influence of short-range topology on folding rates, the degree to which folding proceeds by parallel (versus localized) pathways, and the factors that select among multiple potential pathways. The recent application of force spectroscopy to repeat-protein unfolding is providing a unique route to test and extend many of these findings. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Characterizing the phase diagram for proteins is important both for laboratory studies and for the development of structure prediction algorithms. Using a variational scheme, we calculated the generic features of the protein thermostability over a large range of temperatures for a set of more than 50 different proteins using a model based on native structure alone. Focusing on a specific system, protein G, we further examined, using a more realistic model that includes the nonnative interaction, the thermostability of both the native state and a collection of trap structures. By surveying the native structures for many proteins and by paying closer attention to the various trap structures of protein G, we obtained an overall understanding of the folding dynamics far from the conditions usually focused on; namely, those near the folding temperature alone. Two characteristic temperatures (shown to scale with folding temperature in general) signal drastic changes in the folding mechanism. The variational calculations suggest that most proteins would, indeed, fold in a barrierless manner below a critical temperature analogous to a spinodal in crystallization. For fixed interaction strengths, this temperature, however, seems to be generally very low, approximately 50\% of the equilibrium folding temperature. Likewise, native proteins, in general, would unfold in a completely barrierless way at a temperature 25\% above folding temperature according to these variational calculations. We also studied the distribution of free energy profiles for escape from a set of trap structures generated by simulations.},

	Abstract = {Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the temperature dependence of the absolute heat capacity of the 35-residue subdomain of the villin headpiece, a protein that folds in 5 mus and is therefore assumed to have a small free-energy barrier separating folded and unfolded states. To obtain an estimate of the barrier height from the calorimetric data, two models, a variable-barrier model and an Ising-like model, were used to fit the heat capacity in excess of the folded state over the temperature range 15-125 degrees C. The variable-barrier model is based on an empirical mathematical form for the density of states, with four adjustable parameters and the enthalpy (H) as a reaction coordinate. The Ising-like model is based on the inter-residue contact map of the X-ray structure with exact enumeration of approximately 10(5) possible conformations, with two adjustable parameters in the partition function, and either the fraction of native contacts (Q) or the number of ordered residues (P) as reaction coordinates. The variable-barrier model provides an excellent fit to the data and yields a barrier height at the folding temperature ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 kcal mol(-1), while the Ising-like model provides a less good fit and yields barrier heights of 2.3 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) and 2.1 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) for the Q and P reaction coordinates, respectively. In both models, the barrier to folding increases with increasing temperature. Assuming a sufficiently large activation energy for diffusion on the free-energy surfaces, both models are consistent with the observation of a temperature-independent folding rate in previously published laser temperature-jump experiments. Analysis of this kinetic data, using an approximate form for the pre-exponential factor of Kramers theory and the 70 ns relaxation time for the fast phase that precedes the unfolding/refolding relaxation to determine the diffusion coefficient, results in a barrier height of 1.6 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1 for an unspecified reaction coordinate. Although no independent test of the validity of the H, Q, or P reaction coordinates is given, the barrier-height estimates obtained with the three reaction coordinates are in quite good agreement with the value derived from a Kramers analysis of the kinetics that makes no assumptions about the reaction coordinate. However, the higher estimates obtained using Q or P appear more consistent with the finding of barrier-crossing kinetics of a villin mutant that folds in 700 ns, corresponding to a 1.3 kcal mol-1 reduction in the folding barrier relative to wild-type. All of the results suggest that the free-energy barrier to folding is sufficiently low that it should be possible to engineer this protein or find solution conditions that would eliminate the barrier to create the "downhill" folding scenario of Wolynes and Onuchic.},

	Abstract = {We have demonstrated that, among proteins of the same size, alpha/beta proteins have on the average a greater number of contacts per residue due to their more compact (more "spherical") structure, rather than due to tighter packing. We have examined the relationship between the average number of contacts per residue and folding rates in globular proteins according to general protein structural class (all-alpha, all-beta, alpha/beta, alpha+beta). Our analysis demonstrates that alpha/beta proteins have both the greatest number of contacts and the slowest folding rates in comparison to proteins from the other structural classes. Because alpha/beta proteins are also known to be the oldest proteins, it can be suggested that proteins have evolved to pack more quickly and into looser structures.},

	Abstract = {A number of beta-sandwich immunoglobulin-like domains have been shown to fold using a set of structurally equivalent residues that form a folding nucleus deep within the core of the protein. Formation of this nucleus is sufficient to establish the complex Greek key topology of the native state. These nucleating residues are highly conserved within the immunoglobulin superfamily, but are less well conserved in the fibronectin type III (fnIII) superfamily, where the requirement is simply to have four interacting hydrophobic residues. However, there are rare examples where this nucleation pattern is absent. In this study, we have investigated the folding of a novel member of the fnIII superfamily whose nucleus appears to lack one of the four buried hydrophobic residues. We show that the folding mechanism is unaltered, but the folding nucleus has moved within the hydrophobic core.},

	Abstract = {The first part of this paper contains an overview of protein structures, their spontaneous formation ("folding"), and the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of this phenomenon, as revealed by in vitro experiments. It is stressed that universal features of folding are observed near the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native and denatured states of the protein. Here the "two-state" ("denatured state" ↔ "native state") transition proceeds without accumulation of metastable intermediates, but includes only the unstable "transition state". This state, which is the most unstable in the folding pathway, and its structured core (a "nucleus") are distinguished by their essential influence on the folding/unfolding kinetics. In the second part of the paper, a theory of protein folding rates and related phenomena is presented. First it is shown that the protein size determines the range of a proteins folding rates in the vicinity of the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native and denatured states of the protein. Then, we present methods for calculating folding and unfolding rates of globular proteins from their sizes, stabilities and either 3D structures or amino acid sequences. Finally, we show that the same theory outlines ihe location of the protein folding nucleus (ie., the structured part of the transition, state) in reasonable agreement with experimental data. {\copyright} 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Repeat proteins are composed of tandem structural modules in which close contacts do not extend beyond adjacent repeats. Despite the local nature of these close contacts, repeat proteins often unfold as a single, highly coupled unit. Previous studies on the Notch ankyrin domain suggest that this lack of equilibrium unfolding intermediates results both from stabilizing interfaces between each repeat and from a roughly uniform distribution of stability across the folding energy landscape. To investigate this idea, we have generated 15 variants of the Notch ankyrin domain with single and multiple destabilizing substitutions that make the energy landscape uneven. By applying a free energy additivity analysis to these variants, we quantified the destabilization threshold over which repeats 6 and 7 decouple from repeats 1-5. The free energy coupling limit suggested by this additivity analysis (≈4 kcal/mol) is also reflected in m-value analysis and in differences among equilibrium unfolding transitions as monitored by CD versus fluorescence for all 15 variants. All of these observations are quantitatively predicted by analyzing the response of the experimentally determined energy landscape to increasing unevenness. These results highlight the importance of a uniform distribution of local stability in achieving cooperative unfolding. {\copyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {It has been difficult to obtain directly residue-specific information on side chain packing during a fast (ms) protein folding reaction. Such information is necessary to determine the extent to which structural changes in different parts of the protein molecule are coupled together in defining the cooperativity of the overall folding transition. In this study, structural changes occurring during the major fast folding reaction of the small protein barstar have been characterized at the level of individual residue side chains. A pulsed cysteine labeling methodology has been employed in conjunction with mass spectrometry. This provides, with ms temporal resolution, direct information on structure formation at 10 different locations in barstar during its folding. Cysteine residues located on the surface of native barstar, at four different positions, remain fully solvent-accessible throughout the folding process, indicating the absence of any ephemeral nonnative structure in which these four cysteine residues get transiently buried. For buried cysteine residues, the rates of the change in cysteine-thiol accessibility to rapid chemical labeling by the thiol reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate appear to be dependent upon the location of the cysteine residue in the protein and are different from the rate measured by the change in tryptophan fluorescence. But the rates vary over only a 3-fold range. Nevertheless, a comparison of the kinetics of the change in accessibility of the cysteine 3 thiol with those of the change in the fluorescence of tryptophan 53, as well as of their denaturant dependences, indicates that the major folding reaction comprises more than one step. {\copyright} 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	Abstract = {A protocol was developed to characterize the domain-specific thermodynamic stabilities of multidomain proteins using SUPREX (Stability of Unpurified Proteins from Rates of H/D Exchange). The protocol incorporates a protease digestion step into the conventional SUPREX protocol and enables folding free energy (ΔGf) and cooperativity (m-value) measurements to be made on the individual domains of multidomain proteins in their native context (i.e., in the intact protein). Three multidomain protein systems (calmodulin, a Fyn construct, and transferrin) were used to validate the SUPREX-protease digestion protocol. The ΔGf and m-value of each domain in the intact test proteins were measured in the absence and presence of ligands using the new protocol. Domain-specific thermodynamic parameters were obtained on each system; and the measured parameters were consistent with known biophysical properties of the test proteins. The known stabilization of the N-terminal domain of CaM in the context of the intact protein and the known binding affinity of a proline-rich peptide to the SH3 domain in the Fyn construct were successfully quantified using the new protocol. Qualitative information about the relative calcium binding affinities of the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM and about the relative iron binding affinities of the N- and C-terminal domains of transferrin was also obtained using the new protocol. {\copyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {The phenomena of protein reconstitution and three-dimensional domain swapping reveal that highly similar structures can be obtained whether a protein is comprised of one or more polypeptide chains. In this review, we use protein reconstitution as a lens through which to examine the range of protein tolerance to chain interruptions and the roles of the primary structure in related features of protein structure and folding, including circular permutation, natively unfolded proteins, allostery, and amyloid fibril formation. The results imply that noncovalent interactions in a protein are sufficient to specify its structure under the constraints imposed by the covalent backbone.

	Abstract = {We studied the secondary structure of the C-terminal domains of the histone H1 subtypes H1$\,^{\circ}$ (C-H1$\,^{\circ}$) and H1t (C-H1t) in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents (Ficoll 70 and PEG 6000) by IR spectroscopy. The carboxyl-terminal domain has little structure in aqueous solution but became extensively folded in the presence of crowding agents. In 30% PEG, C-H1$\,^{\circ}$ contained 19% a-helix, 28% β-sheet, 16% turns, and 31% open loops. Similar proportions were observed in 30% Ficoll 70 and for C-H1t in both crowding agents. The proportions of secondary structure motifs were comparable to those of the DNA-bound domain. Kratky plots of the small-angle x-ray scattering showed that in crowding agents the C-terminus had the compaction of a globular state. Progressive dissipation of the secondary structure and a linear increase in partial heat capacity with temperature together with increased binding of ANS indicated that the C-terminus is not cooperatively folded in crowded conditions. Native-like secondary structure and compactness in absence of folding cooperativity indicate that the C-terminus in crowding agents is in a molten globule state. Folding of the C-terminus in crowded conditions may increase the rate of the transition toward the DNA-bound state and facilitate H1 diffusion inside cell nuclei. {\copyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {Proteins fold on a μs-ms time scale. However, the number of possible conformations of the polypeptide backbone is so large that random sampling would not allow the protein to fold within the lifetime of the universe, the Levinthal paradox. We show here that a protein chain can fold efficiently with high fidelity if on average native contacts survive longer than non-native ones, that is, if the dissociation rate constant for breakage of a contact is lower for native than for non-native interactions. An important consequence of this finding is that no pathway needs to be specified for a protein to fold. Instead, kinetic discrimination among formed contacts is a sufficient criterion for folding to proceed to the native state. Successful protein folding requires that productive contacts survive long enough to obtain a certain level of probability that other native contacts form before the first interacting unit dissociates. If native contacts survive longer than non-native ones, this prevents misfolding and provides the folding process with directionality toward the native state. If on average all contacts survive equally long, the protein chain is deemed to fold through random search through all possible conformations (i.e., the Levinthal paradox). A modest degree of cooperativity among the native contacts, that is, decreased dissociation rate next to neighboring contacts, shifts the required ratio of dissociation rates into a realistic regime and makes folding a stochastic process with a nucleation step. No kinetic discrimination needs to be invoked in regards to the association process, which is modeled as dependent on the diffusion rate of chain segments. {\copyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {Initial polypeptide chain collapse plays a major role in the development of subsequent structure during protein folding, but it has been difficult to elucidate the coupling between its cooperativity and specificity. To better understand this important aspect of protein folding, nine different intramolecular distances in the protein have been measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the product(s) of the initial, sub-millisecond collapse reaction during the folding of barstar, under different folding conditions. All nine distances contract in these initial folding products, when the denaturant concentration is reduced. Two of these distances were also measured in peptides corresponding to sequence segments 38-55 and 51-69 of the protein. Surprisingly, both distances do not contract in the peptides which remain fully unfolded when the denaturant concentration is reduced. This suggests that the contraction of at least some segments of the polypeptide chain may be facilitated only by contraction of other segments. In the case of the initial product of folding of the protein, the dependence on denaturant concentration of the relative change in each distance suggests that there are two components to the initial folding reaction. One is a nonspecific component, which appears to be driven by the change in denaturant concentration that is used to initiate refolding. This component corresponds to the collapse of completely unfolded protein (U) to unfolded protein in refolding conditions (UC). The extent of nonspecific collapse can be predicted by the response of completely unfolded protein to a change in denaturant concentration. All distances undergo such solvent-induced contraction, but each distance contracts to a different extent. There is also a specific component to initial sub-millisecond folding, in which some distances (but not all) contract more than that predicted by solvent-induced contraction. The observation that only some of the distances undergo contraction over and above solvent-induced contraction, suggest that this specific component is associated with the formation of a specific intermediate (IE). FRET efficiency and distance change differently for the different donor-acceptor pairs, with a change in denaturant concentration, indicating that the formation or dissolution of structure in UC and IE does not happen in a synchronized manner across different regions of the protein molecule. Also, all nine FRET efficiencies and intramolecular distances in the product(s) of sub-ms folding, change continuously with a change in denaturant concentration. Hence, it appears that the transitions from U to UC and to IE are gradual transformations, and not all-or-none structural transitions. Nevertheless, the product of these gradual transitions, IE, possesses specific structure. {\copyright} 2007.},

	Abstract = {A coarse-grained variational model is used to investigate the polymer dynamics of barrier crossing for a diverse set of two-state folding proteins. The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the transition state ensemble nonuniformly across the set of proteins studied. Nevertheless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of 5. This direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier heights obtained from the model and the best-fit monomer relaxation time 30 ns, we find that 1/k0 ∼ 1-5 μs (with average 1/k0 ∼ 4 μs). This model can be extended to study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate with stability or solvent viscosity and the onset of downhill folding. {\copyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {Calculation of the free energy of protein folding and delineation of its pre-organization are of foremost importance for understanding, predicting and designing biological macromolecules. Here, we introduce an energy smoothing variant of parallel tempering replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMS) that allows for efficient configurational sampling of flexible solutes under the conditions of molecular hydration. Its usage to calculate the thermal stability of a model globular protein, Trp cage TC5b, achieves excellent agreement with experimental measurements. We find that the stability of TC5b is attained through the coupled formation of local and non-local interactions. Remarkably, many of these structures persist at high temperature, concomitant with the origin of native-like configurations and mesostates in an otherwise macroscopically disordered unfolded state. Graph manifold learning reveals that the conversion of these mesostates to the native state is structurally heterogeneous, and that the cooperativity of their formation is encoded largely by the unfolded state ensemble. In all, these studies establish the extent of thermodynamic and structural pre-organization of folding of this model globular protein, and achieve the calculation of macromolecular stability ab initio, as required for ab initio structure prediction, genome annotation, and drug design. {\copyright} 2007 Kentsis et al.},

	Abstract = {Small proteins are generally observed to fold in an apparent two-state manner. Recently, however, more sensitive techniques have demonstrated that even seemingly single-domain proteins are actually made up of smaller subdomains. T4 lysozyme is one such protein. We explored the relative autonomy of its two individual subdomains and their contribution to the overall stability of T4 lysozyme by examining a circular permutation (CP13*) that relocates the N-terminal A-helix, creating subdomains that are contiguous in sequence. By determining the high-resolution structure of CP13* and characterizing its energy landscape using native state hydrogen exchange (NSHX), we show that connectivity between the subdomains is an important determinant of the energetic cooperativity but not structural integrity of the protein. The circular permutation results in a protein more easily able to populate a partially unfolded form in which the C-terminal subdomain is folded and the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded. We also created a fragment model of this intermediate and demonstrate using X-ray crystallography that its structure is identical to the corresponding residues in the full-length protein with the exception of a small network of hydrophobic interactions. In sum, we conclude that the C-terminal subdomain dominates the energetics of T4 lysozyme folding, and the A-helix serves an important role in coupling the two subdomains.

	Abstract = {Intermediates along a protein's folding pathway can play an important role in its biology. Previous kinetics studies have revealed an early folding intermediate for T4 lysozyme, a small, well-characterized protein composed of an N-terminal and a C-terminal subdomain. Pulse-labeling hydrogen exchange studies suggest that residues from both subdomains contribute to the structure of this intermediate. On the other hand, equilibrium native state hydrogen experiments have revealed a high-energy, partially unfolded form of the protein that has an unstructured N-terminal subdomain and a structured C-terminal subdomain. To resolve this discrepancy between kinetics and equilibrium data, we performed detailed kinetics analyses of the folding and unfolding pathways of T4 lysozyme, as well as several point mutants and large-scale variants. The data support the argument for the presence of two distinct intermediates, one present on each side of the rate-limiting transition state barrier. The effects of circular permutation and site-specific mutations in the wild-type and circular permutant background, as well as a fragment containing just the C-terminal subdomain, support a model for the unfolding intermediate with an unfolded N-terminal and a folded C-terminal subdomain. Our results suggest that the partially unfolded form identified by native state hydrogen exchange resides on the folded side of the rate-limiting transition state and is, therefore, under most conditions, a "hidden" intermediate.

	Abstract = {Despite much study, biomolecule folding cooperativity is not well understood. There are quantitative models for helix-coil transitions and for coil-to-globule transitions, but no accurate models yet treat both chain collapse and secondary structure formation together. We develop here a dynamic programming approach to statistical mechanical partition functions of foldamer chain molecules. We call it the ascending levels model. We apply it to helix-coil and helix-bundle folding and cooperativity. For 14- to 50-mer Baldwin peptides, the model gives good predictions for the heat capacity and helicity versus temperature and urea. The model also gives good fits for the denaturation of Oas's three-helix bundle B domain of protein A (F13W*) and synthetic protein α3C by temperature and guanidine. The model predicts the conformational distributions. It shows that these proteins fold with transitions that are two-state, although the transitions in the Baldwin helices are nearly higher order. The model shows that the recently developed three-helix bundle polypeptoids of Lee et al. fold anti-cooperatively, with a predicted value of ΔHvH/ΔHcal = 0.72. The model also predicts that two-helix bundles are unstable in proteins but stable in peptoids. Our dynamic programming approach provides a general way to explore cooperativity in complex foldable polymers. {\copyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {Efficient protein folding implies a microscopic funnel-like multidimensional free-energy landscape. Macroscopically, conformational entropy reduction can manifest itself as part of an empirical barrier in the traditional view of folding, but experiments show that such barriers can also entail significant unfavorable enthalpy changes. This observation raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy, that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large uphill moves and thus the multidimensional free-energy landscape may not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume, is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy, netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier. Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step. {\copyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	Abstract = {Folding stability and cooperativity of the three forms of 1-110 residues fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase110) have been studied by various biophysical and NMR methods. Samples of G-88W- and V-66W-mutant SNase110, namely G-88W110 and V-66W110, in aqueous solution and SNase110 in 2.0 M TMAO are adopted in this study. The unfolding transitions and folded conformations of the three SNase fragments were detected by far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The tertiary structures and internal motions of the fragments were determined byNMR spectroscopy. Both G-88W and V-66W single mutations as well as a small organic osmolyte (Trimethylamine N-oxide, TMAO) can fold the fragment into a native-like conformation. However, the tertiary structures of the three fragments exhibit different degrees of folding stability and compactness. G-88W110 adopts a relatively rigid structure representing a most stable native-like β-subdomain conformation of the three fragments. V-66W110- and TMAO-stabilized SNase110 produce less compact structures having a less stable "β-barrel" structural region. The different folding status accounts for the different backbone dynamic and urea-unfolding transition features of the three fragments. The G-20I/G-29I-mutant variants of the three fragments have provided the evidence that the folding status is correlated closely to the packing of the β-strands in the b-barrel of the fragments. The native-like β-barrel structural region acts as a nonlocal nucleus for folding the fragment. The tertiary folding of the three fragments is initiated by formation of the local nucleation sites at two β-turn regions, I-18-D-21 and Y-27-Q-30, and developed by the formation of a nonlocal nucleation site at the β-barrel region. The formation of β-barrel and overall structure is concerted, but the level of cooperativity is different for the three 1-110 residues SNase fragments. {\copyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {Single amino acid substitutions rarely produce substantial changes in protein structure. Here we show that substitution of the C-cap residue in the α-helix of ubiquitin with proline (34P variant) leads to dramatic structural changes. The resulting conformational perturbation extends over the last two turns of the α-helix and leads to enhanced flexibility for residues 27-37. Thermodynamic analysis of this ubiquitin variant using differential scanning calorimetry reveals that the thermal unfolding transition remains highly cooperative, exhibiting two-state behavior. Similarities with the wild type in the thermodynamic parameters (heat capacity change upon unfolding and m-value) of unfolding monitored by DSC and chemical denaturation suggests that the 34P variant has comparable buried surface area. The hydrophobic core of 34P variant is not packed as well as that of the wild type protein as manifested by a lower enthalpy of unfolding. The increased mobility of the polypeptide chain of this ubiquitin variant allows the transient opening of the hydrophobic core as evidenced by ANS binding. Taken together, these results suggest exceptional robustness of cooperativity in protein structures. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Repeat proteins are constructed from a linear array of modular units, giving rise to an overall topology lacking long-range interactions. This suggests that stabilizing repeat modules based on consensus information might be added to a repeat protein domain, allowing it to be extended without altering its overall topology. Here we add consensus modules the ankyrin repeat domain from the Drosophila Notch receptor to investigate the structural tolerance to these modules, the relative thermodynamic stability of these hybrid proteins, and how alterations in the energy landscape influence folding kinetics. Insertions of consensus modules between repeats five and six of the Notch ankyrin domain have little effect on the far and near-UV CD spectra, indicating that neither secondary nor tertiary structure is dramatically altered. Furthermore, stable structure is maintained at increased denaturant concentrations in the polypeptides containing the consensus repeats, indicating that the consensus modules are capable of stabilizing much of the domain. However, insertion of the consensus repeats appears to disrupt cooperativity, producing a two-stage (three-state) unfolding transition in which the C-terminal repeats unfold at moderate urea concentrations. Removing the C-terminal repeats (Notch ankyrin repeats six and seven) restores equilibrium two-state folding and demonstrates that the high stability of the consensus repeats is propagated into the N-terminal, naturally occurring Notch ankyrin repeats. This stability increase greatly increases the folding rate, and suggests that the transition state ensemble may be repositioned in the chimeric consensus-stabilized proteins in response to local stability. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Spectrin is a multidomain cytoskeletal protein, the component three-helix bundle domains are expected to experience mechanical force in vivo. In thermodynamic and kinetic studies, neighboring domains of chicken brain α-spectrin R16 and R17 have been shown to behave cooperatively. Is this cooperativity maintained under force? The effect of force on these spectrin domains was investigated using atomic force microscopy. The response of the individual domains to force was compared to that of the tandem repeat R1617. Importantly, nonhelical linkers (all-β immunoglobulin domains) were used to avoid formation of nonnative helical linkers. We show that, in contrast to previous studies on spectrin repeats, only 3% of R1617 unfolding events gave an increase in contour length consistent with cooperative two-domain unfolding events. Furthermore, the unfolding forces for R1617 were the same as those for the unfolding of R16 or R17 alone. This is a strong indication that the cooperative unfolding behavior observed in the stopped-flow studies is absent between these spectrin domains when force is acting as a denaturant. Our evidence suggests that the rare double unfolding events result from misfolding between adjacent repeats. We suggest that this switch from cooperative to independent behavior allows multidomain proteins to maintain integrity under applied force. {\copyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

	Abstract = {The protein folding problem can be viewed as three different problems: defining the thermodynamic folding code; devising a good computational structure prediction algorithm; and answering Levinthal's question regarding the kinetic mechanism of how proteins can fold so quickly. Once regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen much progress in recent years. Folding codes are now being used to successfully design proteins and non-biological foldable polymers; aided by the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, protein structure prediction has now become quite good. Even the once-challenging Levinthal puzzle now seems to have an answer--a protein can avoid searching irrelevant conformations and fold quickly by making local independent decisions first, followed by non-local global decisions later.},

	Abstract = {Studies of circular permutants have demonstrated that the folding reaction of S6 from Thermus thermophilus (S6(T)) is malleable and responds in an ordered manner to changes of the sequence separation between interacting residues: the S6(T) permutants retain a common nucleation pattern in the form of a two-strand-helix motif that can be recruited from different parts of the structure. To further test the robustness of the two-strand-helix nucleus we have here determined the crystal structure and folding reaction of an evolutionary divergent S6 protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (S6(A)). Although the overall topology of S6(A) is very similar to that of S6(T) the architecture of the hydrophobic core is radically different by containing a large proportion of stacked Phe side-chains. Despite this disparate core composition, the folding rate constant and the kinetic m values of S6(A) are identical to those of S6(T). The folding nucleus of S6(A) is also found to retain the characteristic two-strand-helix motif of the S6(T) permutants, but with a new structural emphasis. The results suggest that the protein folding reaction is linked to topology only in the sense that the native-state topology determines the repertoire of accessible nucleation motifs. If the native structure allows several equivalent ways of recruiting a productive nucleus the folding reaction is free to redistribute within these topological constraints.},

	Abstract = {Water is essential for life in many ways, and without it biomolecules might no longer truly be biomolecules. In particular, water is important to the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of biological macromolecules. In protein folding, water mediates the collapse of the chain and the search for the native topology through a funneled energy landscape. Water actively participates in molecular recognition by mediating the interactions between binding partners and contributes to either enthalpic or entropic stabilization. Accordingly, water must be included in recognition and structure prediction codes to capture specificity. Thus water should not be treated as an inert environment, but rather as an integral and active component of biomolecular systems, where it has both dynamic and structural roles. Focusing on water sheds light on the physics and function of biological machinery and self-assembly and may advance our understanding of the natural design of proteins and nucleic acids.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability and/or folding kinetics, induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure, mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding. These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years, including the observation of global downhill folding. However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes. Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers (less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.},

	Abstract = {The folding of naturally occurring, single-domain proteins is usually well described as a simple, single-exponential process lacking significant trapped states. Here we further explore the hypothesis that the smooth energy landscape this implies, and the rapid kinetics it engenders, arises due to the extraordinary thermodynamic cooperativity of protein folding. Studying Miyazawa-Jernigan lattice polymers, we find that, even under conditions where the folding energy landscape is relatively optimized (designed sequences folding at their temperature of maximum folding rate), the folding of protein-like heteropolymers is accelerated when their thermodynamic cooperativity is enhanced by enhancing the nonadditivity of their energy potentials. At lower temperatures, where kinetic traps presumably play a more significant role in defining folding rates, we observe still greater cooperativity-induced acceleration. Consistent with these observations, we find that the folding kinetics of our computational models more closely approximates single-exponential behavior as their cooperativity approaches optimal levels. These observations suggest that the rapid folding of naturally occurring proteins is, in part, a consequence of their remarkably cooperative folding.},

	Abstract = {Through extensive experiment, simulation, and analysis of protein S6 (1RIS), we find that variations in nucleation and folding pathway between circular permutations are determined principally by the restraints of topology and specific nucleation, and affected by changes in chain entropy. Simulations also relate topological features to experimentally measured stabilities. Despite many sizable changes in phi values and the structure of the transition state ensemble that result from permutation, we observe a common theme: the critical nucleus in each of the mutants share a subset of residues that can be mapped to the critical nucleus residues of the wild-type. Circular permutations create new N and C termini, which are the location of the largest disruption of the folding nucleus, leading to a decrease in both phi values and the role in nucleation. Mutant nuclei are built around the wild-type nucleus but are biased towards different parts of the S6 structure depending on the topological and entropic changes induced by the location of the new N and C termini.},

@article{kouza:06,
	Abstract = {We analyze the dependence of cooperativity of the thermal denaturation transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, N, using lattice models with side chains, off-lattice Go models, and the available experimental data. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Omega(c) (0 < Omega(c) < infinity), scales as Omega(c) approximately N(zeta). The results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm the earlier prediction that zeta is universal with zeta = 1 + gamma, where exponent gamma characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition temperature. The folding rates k(F) for the Go models and a dataset of 69 proteins can be fit using k(F) = k(F)0 exp(-cN(beta)). Both beta = 1/2 and 2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that k(F) = k(F)0 exp(-cN(1/2)), with the average (over the dataset of proteins) k(F)0 approximately (0.2 micros)(-1) and c approximately 1.1, can be used to estimate folding rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. The minimal models give identical N dependence with c approximately 1. The prefactor for off-lattice Go models is nearly 4 orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.},

	Abstract = {A serious limitation in the study of protein folding reactions resides in the lack of experimental methods to measure the absolute height of the free energy barrier. This is particularly unfortunate given that if folding barriers are small, as theory predicts, it might be possible to resolve folding mechanisms directly. Here we explore the performance of a recently developed method to extract folding barriers from equilibrium differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. To test the method, we compare the thermodynamic barrier heights for 15 proteins obtained from available DSC data with the folding rates measured in kinetic experiments. The correlation between these two parameters is very good (r2 = 0.9) and has a slope consistent with the same energy scale. These results confirm that it is possible to measure free energy barriers for natural proteins from equilibrium DSC experiments. Furthermore, the measured barrier heights are small (<8 RT), in general, and marginal or nonexisting for fast-folding proteins.},

	Abstract = {As different parts of a protein chain approach one another during folding, they are expected to encounter desolvation barriers before optimal packing is achieved. This impediment originates from the water molecule's finite size, which entails a net energetic cost for water exclusion when the formation of compensating close intraprotein contacts is not yet complete. Based on recent advances, we extend our exploration of these microscopic elementary desolvation barriers' roles in the emergence of generic properties of protein folding. Using continuum G{\=o}-like C(alpha) chain models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and barnase as examples, we underscore that elementary desolvation barriers between a protein's constituent groups can significantly reduce native conformational fluctuations relative to model predictions that neglected these barriers. An increasing height of elementary desolvation barriers leads to thermodynamically more cooperative folding/unfolding transitions (i.e., higher overall empirical folding barriers) and higher degrees of kinetic cooperativity as manifested by more linear rate-stability relationships under constant temperature. Applying a spatially non-uniform thermodynamic parametrization we recently introduced for the pairwise C(alpha) potentials of mean force, the present barnase model further illustrates that desolvation is a probable physical underpinning for the experimentally observed high intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions.},

	Abstract = {An approach to predicting folding nuclei in globular proteins with known three-dimensional structures is proposed. This approach is based on the pinpointing of the lowest saddle points on the barrier between the unfolded state and native structure on the free-energy landscape of a protein chain; the proposed technique uses the dynamic programming method. A comparison of calculation results with experimental data on the folding nuclei of 21 proteins shows that the model provides good Φ value predictions for protein structures determined by X-ray analysis and, less successfully, in structures determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. Consideration of the whole ensemble of transition states provides a better prediction of folding nuclei than consideration of only transition states with lowest free energies. In addition, we predict the location of folding nuclei in three-dimensional structures of some proteins whose folding kinetics is being studied, but there is no experimental evidence concerning their folding nuclei. {\copyright} 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We have compared structures of 78 proteins determined by both NMR and X-ray methods. It is shown that X-ray and NMR structures of the same protein have more differences than various X-ray structures obtained for the protein, and even more than various NMR structures of the protein. X-ray and NMR structures of 18 of these 78 proteins have obvious large-scale structural differences that seem to reflect a difference of crystal and solution structures. The other 60 pairs of structures have only small-scale differences comparable with differences between various X-ray or various NMR structures of a protein; we have analyzed these structures more attentively. One of the main differences between NMR and X-ray structures concerns the number of contacts per residue: (1) NMR structures presented in PDB have more contacts than X-ray structures at distances below 3.0 {\AA} and 4.5-6.5 {\AA}, and fewer contacts at distances of 3.0-4.5 {\AA} and 6.5-8.0 {\AA}; (2) this difference in the number of contacts is greater for internal residues than for external ones, and it is larger for β-containing proteins than for all-α proteins. Another significant difference is that the main-chain hydrogen bonds identified in X-ray and NMR structures often differ. Their correlation is 69% only. However, analogous difference is found for refined and rerefined NMR structures, allowing us to suggest that the observed difference in interresidue contacts of X-ray and NMR structures of the same proteins is due mainly to a difference in mathematical treatment of experimental results. {\copyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Our theoretical approach for prediction of folding/unfolding nuclei in three-dimensional protein structures is based on a search for free energy saddle points on networks of protein unfolding pathways. Under some approximations, this search is rapidly performed by dynamic programming and results in prediction of O values, which can be compared with those found experimentally. We show that the presented theoretical approach can be used to outline a folding nucleus in proteins' 3D structure. We demonstrate that incorporation of such 'details' as hydrogen atoms (in addition to the heavy ones) improves prediction of the folding nuclei. Themodel provides good predictions of folding nuclei for proteins whose 3D structures have been determined by x-ray, and is less successful for proteins whose structures have been determined by NMR. Besides, the same dynamic programming-based calculation yields the transition state free energy, and thus allows one to estimate the protein folding rate. A more direct estimate of the folding rate can be obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of refolding of known 3D protein structure, which is also described in this work. The refolding times obtained from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo simulations correlate reasonably well with logarithms of experimentally measured folding rates at mid-transition. {\copyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Experimental data from global analyses of temperature (T) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the T-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is Arrhenius. Furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/T is essentially independent of native stability. This hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and Eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. Using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-Eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. These enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. Intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. Using a class of explicit-chain C(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between C(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. This theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics. Ramifications of entropy-enthalpy compensation in hydrophobic association for the height of enthalpic desolvation barrier are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Current experimental data show a 9-orders-of-magnitude span in the folding times of proteins. Such a wide range is typically considered a direct consequence of the complexity in structural and sequence patterns of natural proteins. By using a database of 69 proteins and peptides analyzed experimentally, we observe that the folding time scales with the number of residues in the protein. The correlation coefficient is 0.74 or higher, and indicates that it is possible to predict the folding time of a protein with a precision of approximately 1.1 times decades from just its size. A simple thermodynamic analysis of this correlation suggests that the smallest proteins are expected to have very marginal free energy barriers to folding.},

	Abstract = {Our theoretical approach for prediction of folding/unfolding nuclei in three-dimensional protein structures is based on a search for free energy saddle points on networks of protein unfolding pathways. Under some approximations, this search is performed rapidly by dynamic programming and results in prediction of Φ values, which can be compared with those found experimentally. In this study, we optimize some details of the model (specifically, hydrogen atoms are taken into account in addition to heavy atoms), and compare the theoretically obtained and experimental Φ values (which characterize involvement of residues in folding nuclei) for all 17 proteins, where Φ values are now known for many residues. We show that the model provides good Φ value predictions for proteins whose structures have been determined by X-ray analysis (the average correlation coefficient is 0.65), with a more limited success for proteins whose structures have been determined by NMR techniques only (the average correlation coefficient is 0.34), and that the transition state free energies computed from the same model are in a good anticorrelation with logarithms of experimentally measured folding rates at mid-transition (the correlation coefficient is -0.73). {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Here we study the effects of many-body interactions on rate and mechanism in protein folding by using the results of molecular dynamics simulations on numerous coarse-grained Cα-model single-domain proteins. After adding three-body interactions explicitly as a perturbation to a G{\=o}-like Hamiltonian with native pairwise interactions only, we have found (i) a significantly increased correlation with experimental φ values and folding rates, (ii) a stronger correlation of folding rate with contact order, matching the experimental range in rates when the fraction of three-body energy in the native state is ≈20%, and (iii) a considerably larger amount of three-body energy present in chymotripsin inhibitor than in the other proteins studied.},

@article{henry:04,
	Abstract = {A combinatorial approach has been used to determine the optimal assumptions and robustness of simple statistical mechanical models for protein folding. By combining alternative plausible assumptions and different enumeration schemes for constructing partition functions, 76 closely related Ising-like models were generated. These include various contiguous sequence approximations, the possibility of forming a disordered loop between ordered segments, the use of an atomistic or coarse-grained representation of the protein structure, and the choice of ordered residues or native contacts as a reaction coordinate. We also consider all 2N conformations of an N-residue protein (e.g., 10 30 conformations for a 100-residue protein). Although the number of configurations is much too large to list, a free energy profile can be calculated using a build-up procedure by accumulation and recombination of partial partition functions. The predictions of the 76 models were tested against two kinds of experimental data - folding rates and the determination of two-state behavior for 25 proteins. Two-state behavior was judged by the relative magnitude of the dominant relaxation calculated from the rate matrix for motion on the free energy profile. The relative performance of each assumption was evaluated using rank sum statistics which show, with the exception of the single sequence approximation, that this class of models is not sensitive to alternative assumptions. Two-state free energy profiles are calculated for almost all but the α-helical proteins, and surprisingly accurate rates are predicted in both the absence and presence of denaturant. The combinatorics also show that an α-carbon representation of the protein structure does nearly as well as atomistic descriptions, possibly reflecting partial interatomic interactions between native residues in structures of the transition state ensemble. With its coarse-grained description of both the energy and entropy, and only 3 or 4 adjustable parameters, the α-carbon version may be regarded as the simplest possible analytical model of protein folding capable of predicting experimental properties of specific proteins. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It assumes that folding processes are dominated by small-loop closure events that can be inferred from native structures. For CI2, the src SH3 domain, TNfn3, and protein L, the model reproduces two-state kinetics, and it predicts well the average Phi-values for secondary structures. The barrier to folding is the formation of predominantly local structures such as helices and hairpins, which are needed to bring nonlocal pairs of amino acids into contact.},

	Abstract = {Guided by the recent success of empirical model predicting the folding rates of small two-state folding proteins from the relative contact order (CO) of their native structures, by a theoretical model of protein folding that predicts that logarithm of the folding rate decreases with the protein chain length L as L(2/3), and by the finding that the folding rates of multistate folding proteins strongly correlate with their sizes and have very bad correlation with CO, we reexamined the dependence of folding rate on CO and L in attempt to find a structural parameter that determines folding rates for the totality of proteins. We show that the Abs_CO = CO x L, is able to predict rather accurately folding rates for both two-state and multistate folding proteins, as well as short peptides, and that this Abs_CO scales with the protein chain length as L(0.70 +/- 0.07) for the totality of studied single-domain proteins and peptides.},

	Abstract = {Physical mechanisms underlying the empirical correlation between relative contact order (CO) and folding rate among naturally occurring small single-domain proteins are investigated by evaluating postulated interaction schemes for a set of three-dimensional 27mer lattice protein models with 97 different CO values. Many-body interactions are constructed such that contact energies become more favorable when short chain segments sequentially adjacent to the contacting residues adopt native-like conformations. At a given interaction strength, this scheme leads to folding rates that are logarithmically well correlated with CO (correlation coefficient r = 0.914) and span more than 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas folding rates of the corresponding G{\=o} models with additive contact energies have much less logarithmic correlation with CO and span only approximately one order of magnitude. The present protein chain models also exhibit calorimetric cooperativity and linear chevron plots similar to that observed experimentally for proteins with apparent simple two-state folding/unfolding kinetics. Thus, our findings suggest that CO-dependent folding rates of real proteins may arise partly from a significant positive coupling between nonlocal contact favorabilities and local conformational preferences. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Simple two-state folding kinetics of many small single-domain proteins are characterized by chevron plots with linear folding and unfolding arms consistent with an apparent two-state description of equilibrium thermodynamics. This phenomenon is hereby recognized as a nontrivial heteropolymer property capable of providing fundamental insight into protein energetics. Many current protein chain models, including common lattice and continuum G{\=o} models with explicit native biases, fail to reproduce this generic protein property. Here we show that simple two-state kinetics is obtainable from models with a cooperative inter-play between core burial and local conformational propensities or an extra strongly favorable energy for the native structure. These predictions suggest that intramolecular recognition in real two-state proteins is more specific than that envisioned by common G{\=o}-like constructs with pairwise additive energies. The many-body interactions in the present kinetically two-state models lead to high thermodynamic cooperativity as measured by their van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy ratios, implying that the native and denatured conformational populations are well separated in enthalpy by a high free-energy barrier. It has been observed experimentally that deviations from Arrhenius behavior are often more severe for folding than for unfolding. This asymmetry may be rationalized by one of the present modeling scenarios if the effective many-body cooperative interactions stabilizing the native structure against unfolding is less dependent on temperature than the interactions that drive the folding kinetics. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We develop a simple model for computing the rates and routes of folding of two-state proteins from the contact maps of their native structures. The model is based on the graph-theoretical concept of effective contact order (ECO). The model predicts that proteins fold by "zipping up" in a sequence of small-loop-closure events, depending on the native chain fold. Using a simple equation, with a few physical rate parameters, we obtain a good correlation with the folding rates of 24 two-state folding proteins. The model rationalizes data from Phi-value analysis that have been interpreted in terms of delocalized or polarized transition states. This model indicates how much of protein folding may take place in parallel, not along a single reaction coordinate or with a single transition state.},

	Abstract = {What energetic and solvation effects underlie the remarkable two-state thermodynamics and folding/unfolding kinetics of small single-domain proteins? To address this question, we investigate the folding and unfolding of a hierarchy of continuum Langevin dynamics models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. We find that residue-based additive G{\=o}-like contact energies, although native-centric, are by themselves insufficient for protein-like calorimetric two-state cooperativity. Further native biases by local conformational preferences are necessary for protein-like thermodynamics. Kinetically, however, even models with both contact and local native-centric energies do not produce simple two-state chevron plots. Thus a model protein's thermodynamic cooperativity is not sufficient for simple two-state kinetics. The models tested appear to have increasing internal friction with increasing native stability, leading to chevron rollovers that typify kinetics that are commonly referred to as non-two-state. The free energy profiles of these models are found to be sensitive to the choice of native contacts and the presumed spatial ranges of the contact interactions. Motivated by explicit-water considerations, we explore recent treatments of solvent granularity that incorporate desolvation free energy barriers into effective implicit-solvent intraprotein interactions. This additional feature reduces both folding and unfolding rates vis-{\`a}-vis that of the corresponding models without desolvation barriers, but the kinetics remain non-two-state. Taken together, our observations suggest that interaction mechanisms more intricate than simple G{\=o}-like constructs and pairwise additive solvation-like contributions are needed to rationalize some of the most basic generic protein properties. Therefore, as experimental constraints on protein chain models, requiring a consistent account of protein-like thermodynamic and kinetic cooperativity can be more stringent and productive for some applications than simply requiring a model heteropolymer to fold to a target structure.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the principles underlying the protein-folding problem can be tested by developing and characterizing simple models that make predictions which can be compared to experimental data. Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinetics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r=0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r=0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.},

	Abstract = {We perform folding simulations on 18 small proteins with using a simple Go-like protein model and analyze the folding rate constants, characteristics of the transition state ensemble, and those of the denatured states in terms of native topology and chain length. Near the folding transition temperature, the folding rate k(F) scales as k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO N(0.6)) where RCO and N are the relative contact order and number of residues, respectively. Here the topology RCO dependence of the rates is close to that found experimentally (k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO)), while the chain length N dependence is in harmony with the predicted scaling property (k(F) approximately exp(-c N(2/3))). Thus, this may provides a unified scaling law in folding rates at the transition temperature, k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO N(2/3)). The degree of residual structure in the denatured state is highly correlated with RCO, namely, proteins with smaller RCO tend to have more ordered structure in the denatured state. This is consistent with the observation that many helical proteins such as myoglobin and protein A, have partial helices, in the denatured states. The characteristics of the transition state ensemble calculated by the current model, which uses native topology but not sequence specific information, are consistent with experimental phi-value data for about half of proteins.},

	Abstract = {The motions involved in barrier crossing for protein folding are investigated in terms of the chain dynamics of the polymer backbone, completing the microscopic description of protein folding presented in the preceding paper. Local reaction coordinates are identified as collective growth modes of the unstable fluctuations about the saddle points in the free energy surface. The description of the chain dynamics incorporates internal friction (independent of the solvent viscosity) arising from the elementary isomerization of the backbone dihedral angles. We find that the folding rate depends linearly on the solvent friction for high viscosity, but saturates at low viscosity because of internal friction. For lambda -repressor, the calculated folding rate prefactor, along with the free energy barrier from the variational theory, gives a folding rate that agrees well with the experimentally determined rate under highly stabilizing conditions, but the theory predicts too large a folding rate at the transition midpoint. This discrepancy obtained using a fairly complete quantitative theory inspires a new set of questions about chain dynamics, specifically detailed motions in individual contact formation.

	Abstract = {
The role of desolvation in protein binding kinetics is investigated using Brownian dynamics simulations in complexes in which the electrostatic interactions are relatively weak. We find that partial desolvation, modeled by a short-range atomic contact potential, is not only a major contributor to the binding free energy but also substantially increases the diffusion-limited rate for complexes in which long-range electrostatics is weak. This rate enhancement is mostly due to weakly specific pathways leading to a low free-energy attractor, i.e., a precursor state before docking. For [alpha]-chymotrypsin and human leukocyte elastase, both interacting with turkey ovomucoid third domain, we find that the forward rate constant associated with a collision within a solid angle [phi] around their corresponding attractor approaches 107 and 106†M-1s-1, respectively, in the limit [phi]†~†2∞. Because these estimates agree well with experiments, we conclude that the final bound conformation must be preceded by a small set of well-defined diffusion-accessible precursor states. The inclusion of the otherwise repulsive desolvation interaction also explains the lack of aggregation in proteins by restricting nonspecific association times to ~4†ns. Under the same reaction conditions but without short range forces, the association rate would be only ~103†M-1s-1. Although desolvation increases these rates by three orders of magnitude, desolvation-mediated association is still at least 100-fold slower than the electrostatically assisted binding in complexes such as barnase and barstar.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding and binding are kindred processes. Many proteins in the cell are unfolded, so folding and function are coupled. This paper investigates how binding kinetics is influenced by the folding of a protein. We find that a relatively unstructured protein molecule can have a greater capture radius for a specific binding site than the folded state with its restricted conformational freedom. In this scenario of binding, the unfolded state binds weakly at a relatively large distance followed by folding as the protein approaches the binding site: the "fly-casting mechanism." We illustrate this scenario with the hypothetical kinetics of binding a single repressor molecule to a DNA site and find that the binding rate can be significantly enhanced over the rate of binding of a fully folded protein.},

These approximations provide upper and lower bounds and are able to capture the correct asymptotic behavior for both a slowly fluctuating environment and a rapidly relaxing environment. Intermittency, as observed in single molecule experiments, can also be computed using the same approximations. We highlight the relationship of these approximations to previous approaches and compare variational results to exactly solvable examples.},

@article{alm:99,
	Abstract = {Guided by recent experimental results suggesting that protein-folding rates and mechanisms are determined largely by native-state topology, we develop a simple model for protein folding free-energy landscapes based on native-state structures. The configurations considered by the model contain one or two contiguous stretches of residues ordered as in the native structure with all other residues completely disordered; the free energy of each configuration is the difference between the entropic cost of ordering the residues, which depends on the total number of residues ordered and the length of the loop between the two ordered segments, and the favorable attractive interactions, which are taken to be proportional to the total surface area buried by the ordered residues in the native structure. Folding kinetics are modeled by allowing only one residue to become ordered/disordered at a time, and a rigorous and exact method is used to identify free-energy maxima on the lowest free-energy paths connecting the fully disordered and fully ordered configurations. The distribution of structure in these free-energy maxima, which comprise the transition-state ensemble in the model, are reasonably consistent with experimental data on the folding transition state for five of seven proteins studied. Thus, the model appears to capture, at least in part, the basic physics underlying protein folding and the aspects of native-state topology that determine protein-folding mechanisms.

We discuss the formulation of free energy functionals that describe the formation of structure in partially folded proteins. These free energy functionals take into account the inhomogeneous nature of contact energies, chain entropy and cooperative contributions reflecting the many body character of some folding forces like hydrophobicity, but do not directly account for non-native contacts because they assume the validity of the minimal frustration principle. We show how the free energy functionals can be used to interpret experiments on partially folded proteins that probe the fractional occupancy of specific local structures. In particular, we study the hydrogen protection factors in lysozyme studied in transient experiments by Gladwin and Evans and by Nash and Jonas using equilibrium pressure denaturation and the NMR order parameters measured by Dobson and Kim for the homologous protein [alpha]-lactalbumin.},

Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration regulate calmodulin in three distinct ways. First, at the cellular level, by directing its subcellular distribution. Second, at the molecular level, by promoting different modes of association with many target proteins. Third, by directing a variety of conformational states in calmodulin that result in target-specific activation. The calmodulin-dependent regulation of protein kinases illustrates the potential mechanisms by which Ca2+-sensing proteins can recognize and generate affinity and specificity for effectors in a Ca2+-dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {Pulsed-field gradient (PFG) diffusion NMR spectroscopy studies were conducted with several helix-loop-helix regulatory Ca(2+)-binding proteins to characterize the conformational changes associated with Ca(2+)-saturation and/or binding targets. The calmodulin (CaM) system was used as a basis for evaluation, with similar hydrodynamic radii (R(h)) obtained for apo- and Ca(2+)-CaM, consistent with previously reported R(h) data. In addition, conformational changes associated with CaM binding to target peptides from myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), phosphodiesterase (PDE), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were accurately determined compared with small-angle X-ray scattering results. Both sets of data demonstrate the well-established collapse of the extended Ca(2+)-CaM molecule into a globular complex upon peptide binding. The R(h) of CaM complexes with target peptides from CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) and an N-terminal portion of the SIV peptide (SIV-N), as well as the anticancer drug cisplatin were also determined. The CaMKI complex demonstrates a collapse analogous to that observed for MLCK, PDE, and SIV, while the SIV-N shows only a partial collapse. Interestingly, the covalent CaM-cisplatin complex shows a near complete collapse, not expected from previous studies. The method was extended to related calcium binding proteins to show that the R(h) of calcium and integrin binding protein (CIB), calbrain, and the calcium-binding region from soybean calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) decrease on Ca(2+)-binding to various extents. Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy suggests that for CIB and calbrain this is likely because of shifting the equilibrium from unfolded to folded conformations, with calbrain forming a dimer structure. These results demonstrate the utility of PFG-diffusion NMR to rapidly and accurately screen for molecular size changes on protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions for this class of proteins.},

	Abstract = {The central helical region of calmodulin (CaM) includes amino acids 65-92 and serves to separate the two pairs of Ca2(+)-binding sites. This region may impart conformational flexibility and also interact with target proteins. The functional effects of deleting two, three, five, or eight amino acids from the central helix were monitored by examining the activation of phosphodiesterase, smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). CaMDM(-8), a calmodulin-deletion mutant with 8 amino acids deleted from the middle of the central helix, failed to activate MLC kinase, phosphodiesterase, or CaM kinase II at physiologically significant concentrations of activator but also had altered electrophoretic mobility and tyrosine fluorescence properties suggesting major changes in the structure of this mutant. Deletion of five amino acids (77-81) resulted in an increase in apparent Kact for phosphodiesterase (150-fold), CaM kinase II (25-fold), and MLC kinase (5-fold) relative to CaM. The maximal autophosphorylation activity of CaM kinase II was also diminished 70\% with CaMDM(-5). For phosphodiesterase activation, CaMDM(-2) has a 15-fold increase in apparent Kact while CaMDM(-3) had an apparent Kact value only 3-fold higher than native CaM. In contrast, the activation of MLC kinase by the two (79-80)- and three (79-81)-amino acid deletion mutants were indistinguishable from each other or native CaM. CaMDM(-2) and CaMDM(-3) stimulated CaM kinase II autophosphorylation to 85 and 70\%, respectively, of native CaM with less than a 2-fold increase in Kact. Therefore, all deletions in the central helix of CaM reduce the efficiency of phosphodiesterase activation as reflected by substantial alterations in Kact. MLC kinase activation, however, is relatively insensitive to small two or three amino acid deletions. CaM kinase II interacts with the central helix deletion mutants in a complex manner with alterations in both the Kact and the maximum activity. The data suggest the central helix of CaM may serve as a flexible tether for MLC kinase (and to a lesser extent CaM kinase II) but that an extended conformation of CaM, as predicted from the crystal structure, may be required for phosphodiesterase activation.},

The critical glutamate in Site 4 was mutated to create two mutants of the C-domain of calmodulin yielding E140D and E140Q. These proteins were stably folded in the absence of calcium, but had dramatically impaired binding of calcium. We determined the stability of the mutant proteins in the absence and presence of calcium using urea-induced unfolding monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. These calcium-dependent unfolding curves were fit to models that allowed for linkage of stability to binding of a single calcium ion to the native and unfolded states. Simultaneous analysis of the unfolding profiles for each mutant yielded estimates for calcium-binding constants that were consistent with results from direct titrations monitored by fluorescence. Binding to the unfolded state was not an important energetic contributor to the ligand-linked stability of these mutants.},

	Abstract = {Cooperative calcium binding to the two homologous domains of calmodulin (CaM) induces conformational changes that regulate its association with and activation of numerous cellular target proteins. Calcium binding to the pair of high-affinity sites (III and IV in the C-domain) can be monitored by observing calcium-dependent changes in intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence intensity (lambda(ex)/lambda(em) of 277/320 nm). However, calcium binding to the low-affinity sites (I and II in the N-domain) is more difficult to measure with optical spectroscopy because that domain of CaM does not contain tryptophan or tyrosine. We recently demonstrated that calcium-dependent changes in intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence (lambda(ex)/lambda(em) of 250/280 nm) of an N-domain fragment of CaM reflect occupancy of sites I and II (VanScyoc, W. S., and M. A. Shea, 2001, Protein Sci. 10:1758-1768). Using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence methods, we now show that these excitation and emission wavelength pairs for phenylalanine and tyrosine fluorescence can be used to monitor equilibrium calcium titrations of the individual domains in full-length CaM. Calcium-dependent changes in phenylalanine fluorescence specifically indicate ion occupancy of sites I and II in the N-domain because phenylalanine residues in the C-domain are nonemissive. Tyrosine emission from the C-domain does not interfere with phenylalanine fluorescence signals from the N-domain. This is the first demonstration that intrinsic fluorescence may be used to monitor calcium binding to each domain of CaM. In this way, we also evaluated how mutations of two residues (Arg74 and Arg90) located between sites II and III can alter the calcium-binding properties of each of the domains. The mutation R74A caused an increase in the calcium affinity of sites I and II in the N-domain. The mutation R90A caused an increase in calcium affinity of sites III and IV in the C-domain whereas R90G caused an increase in calcium affinity of sites in both domains. This approach holds promise for exploring the linked energetics of calcium binding and target recognition.},

	Abstract = {Calcium sensor proteins translate transient increases in intracellular calcium levels into metabolic or mechanical responses, by undergoing dramatic conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding. A detailed analysis of the calcium binding-induced conformational changes in the representative calcium sensors calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C was performed to obtain insights into the underlying molecular basis for their response to the binding of calcium. Distance difference matrices, analysis of interresidue contacts, comparisons of interhelical angles, and inspection of structures using molecular graphics were used to make unbiased comparisons of the various structures. The calcium-induced conformational changes in these proteins are dominated by reorganization of the packing of the four helices within each domain. Comparison of the closed and open conformations confirms that calcium binding causes opening within each of the EF-hands. A secondary analysis of the conformation of the C-terminal domain of CaM (CaM-C) clearly shows that CaM-C occupies a closed conformation in the absence of calcium that is distinct from the semi-open conformation observed in the C-terminal EF-hand domains of myosin light chains. These studies provide insight into the structural basis for these changes and into the differential response to calcium binding of various members of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family. Factors contributing to the stability of the Ca2+-loaded open conformation are discussed, including a new hypothesis that critical hydrophobic interactions stabilize the open conformation in Ca2+ sensors, but are absent in "non-sensor" proteins that remain closed upon Ca2+ binding. A role for methionine residues in stabilizing the open conformation is also proposed.},

	Abstract = {Important Ca2+ signals in the cytosol and organelles are often extremely localized and hard to measure. To overcome this problem we have constructed new fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ that are genetically encoded without cofactors and are targetable to specific intracellular locations. We have dubbed these fluorescent indicators 'cameleons'. They consist of tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and an enhanced green- or yellow-emitting GFP. Binding of Ca2+ makes calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the flanking GFPs. Calmodulin mutations can tune the Ca2+ affinities to measure free Ca2+ concentrations in the range 10(-8) to 10(-2) M. We have visualized free Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum of single HeLa cells transfected with complementary DNAs encoding chimaeras bearing appropriate localization signals. Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum of individual cells ranged from 60 to 400 microM at rest, and 1 to 50 microM after Ca2+ mobilization. FRET is also an indicator of the reversible intermolecular association of cyan-GFP-labelled calmodulin with yellow-GFP-labelled M13. Thus FRET between GFP mutants can monitor localized Ca2+ signals and protein heterodimerization in individual live cells.},

	Abstract = {In the present investigation, the Ca2+ activation of the C-terminal domain of bovine calmodulin and the effects of replacing the bidentate Ca2+-coordinating glutamic acid residue in the 12th and last position of loop IV with a glutamine are studied by NMR spectroscopy. The mutation E140Q results in sequential Ca2+ binding in this domain and has far-reaching effects on the structure of (Ca2+)2 TR2C, thereby providing further evidence for the critical role of this glutamic acid residue for the Ca2+-induced conformational change of regulatory EF-hand proteins. Analyses of the NOESY spectra of the mutant under Ca2+-saturated conditions, such that 97\% of the protein is in the (Ca2+)2 form, revealed two sets of mutually exclusive NOEs. One set of NOEs is found to be consistent with the closed structure observed in the apo state of the C-terminal domain of the wild-type protein, while the other set supports the open structure observed in the Ca2+-saturated state. In addition, several residues in the hydrophobic core exhibit broadened resonances. We conclude that the (Ca2+)2 form of the mutant experiences a global conformational exchange between states similar to the closed and open conformations of the C-terminal domain of wild-type calmodulin. A population of 65 +/- 15\% of the open conformation and an exchange rate of (1-7) x 10(4) s(-1) were estimated from the NMR data and the chemical shifts of the wild-type protein. From a Ca2+ titration of the 15N-labeled mutant, the macroscopic binding constants [log(K1) = 4.9 +/- 0.3 and log(K2) = 3.15 +/- 0.10] and the inherent chemical shifts of the intermediate (Ca2+)1 form of the mutant were determined using NMR. Valuable information was also provided on the mechanism of the Ca2+ activation and the roles of the structural elements in the two Ca2+-binding events. Comparison with the wild-type protein indicates that the (Ca2+)1 conformation of the mutant is essentially closed but that some rearrangement of the empty loop IV toward the Ca2+-bound form has occurred.},

The final crystallographic R-factor, using 14,469 reflections in the 10.0 to 1.7 A range with structure factors exceeding 0.5 sigma, is 0.216. Bond lengths and bond angle distances have root-mean-square deviations from ideal values of 0.009 A and 0.032 A, respectively. The final model consists of 1279 non-hydrogen atoms, including four calcium ions, 1130 protein atoms, including three Asp118 side-chain atoms in double conformation, 139 water molecules and one ethanol molecule. The electron densities for residues 1 to 4 and 148 of calmodulin are poorly defined, and not included in our model, except for main-chain atoms of residue 4. The calmodulin structure from our crystals is very similar to the earlier 2.2 A structure described by Babu and coworkers with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.36 A. Calmodulin remains a dumb-bell-shaped molecule, with similar lobes and connected by a central alpha-helix. Each lobe contains three alpha-helices and two Ca2+ binding EF hand loops, with a short antiparallel beta-sheet between adjacent EF hand loops and one non-EF hand loop. There are some differences in the structure of the central helix. The crystal packing is extensively studied, and facile crystal growth along the z-axis of the triclinic crystals is explained.

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional solution structure of the complex between calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) and a 26-residue synthetic peptide comprising the CaM binding domain (residues 577 to 602) of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, has been determined using multidimensional heteronuclear filtered and separated nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two domains of CaM (residues 6 to 73 and 83 to 146) remain essentially unchanged upon complexation. The long central helix (residues 65 to 93), however, which connects the two domains in the crystal structure of Ca(2+)-CaM, is disrupted into two helices connected by a long flexible loop (residues 74 to 82), thereby enabling the two domains to clamp residues 3 to 21 of the bound peptide, which adopt a helical conformation. The overall structure of the complex is globular, approximating an ellipsoid of dimensions 47 by 32 by 30 angstroms. The helical peptide is located in a hydrophobic channel that passes through the center of the ellipsoid at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with its long axis. The complex is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions which, from the CaM side, involve an unusually large number of methionines. Key residues of the peptide are Trp4 and Phe17, which serve to anchor the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the peptide to the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of CaM, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that a number of peptides that bind CaM with high affinity share this common feature containing either aromatic residues or long-chain hydrophobic ones separated by a stretch of 12 residues, suggesting that they interact with CaM in a similar manner.},

Bond lengths and bond angles in the molecule have root-mean-square deviations from ideal values of 0.016 A and 1.7 degrees, respectively.

The molecule is shaped somewhat like a dumbbell, with an overall length of 65 A; the two lobes are connected by a seven-turn alpha-helix. Prominent secondary structural features include seven alpha-helices, four Ca2+-binding loops, and two short, double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets between pairs of adjacent Ca2+-binding loops. The four Ca2+-binding domains in calmodulin have a typical EF hand conformation (helix-loop-helix) and are similar to those described in other Ca2+-binding proteins. The X-ray structure determination of calmodulin shows a large hydrophobic cleft in each half of the molecule. These hydrophobic regions probably represent the sites of interaction with many of the pharmacological agents known to bind to calmodulin.},

	Abstract = {The study of associations between two biomolecules is the key to understanding molecular function and recognition. Molecular function is often thought to be determined by underlying structures. Here, combining a single-molecule study of protein binding with an energy-landscape-inspired microscopic model, we found strong evidence that biomolecular recognition is determined by flexibilities in addition to structures. Our model is based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics on the residue level with the energy function biased toward the native binding structure (the Go model). With our model, the underlying free-energy landscape of the binding can be explored. There are two distinct conformational states at the free-energy minimum, one with partial folding of CBD itself and significant interface binding of CBD to Cdc42, and the other with native folding of CBD itself and native interface binding of CBD to Cdc42. This shows that the binding process proceeds with a significant interface binding of CBD with Cdc42 first, without a complete folding of CBD itself, and that binding and folding are then coupled to reach the native binding state. The single-molecule experimental finding of dynamic fluctuations among the loosely and closely bound conformational states can be identified with the theoretical, calculated free-energy minimum and explained quantitatively in the model as a result of binding associated with large conformational changes. The theoretical predictions identified certain key residues for binding that were consistent with mutational experiments. The combined study identified fundamental mechanisms and provided insights about designing and further exploring biomolecular recognition with large conformational changes.},

@article{espinoza-fonseca:09,
	Abstract = {In recent years, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have attracted a lot of attention given the functional importance inherent to their flexible nature. One of the most intriguing features of IDPs is their ability to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding in order to perform their function. Although the importance of intermolecular interactions involving IDPs has been widely recognized, there are divergent views on their binding mechanisms. Among the existing mechanistic models, two of them have gained popularity in the IDP field: the 'conformational selection' and the 'coupled folding and binding.' The first mechanism suggests that folding of IDPs precedes binding, while the second mechanism argues that folding may only take place upon binding. It has been suggested that both models are valid, although they work independently. However, reinterpretation of recent experimental and theoretical data indicates that both models have much more in common that it has been thought. In this manuscript, it is proposed that both mechanistic models should be merged into a single one: the synergistic model. In this model, both 'conformational selection' and 'coupled folding and binding' will synergistically participate in the binding of IDPs. To what extent each model will contribute to the full binding mechanism will depend on the required rate of binding, IDPs concentration, the native local plasticity of IDPs, the degree of binding degeneracy and the type of disorder-to-order transition. Furthermore, it is proposed that combination of the two mechanisms would bring tremendous advantages to IDP binding. For example, synergy may effectively modulate binding kinetics, balance the delicate interplay between enthalpy and entropy by using the funneled energy landscape more efficiently, thus yielding high specificity with carefully balanced free energy of binding. Given the advantages of the synergistic model, it is proposed that it will provide the basis to fully understand the complex nature of IDP binding.},

	Abstract = {Conformational transitions play a central role in the phosphorylation mechanisms of protein kinase. To understand the nature of these transitions, we investigated the dynamics of nucleotide binding to the catalytic domain of PKA, a prototype for the protein kinase enzyme family. The open-to-closed transition in PKA was constructed as a function of ATP association by using available X-ray data and Brownian dynamics. Analyzing the multiple kinetic trajectories at the residue level, we find that the spatial rearrangement of the residues around the nucleotide-binding pocket, along with suppressed local fluctuations, controls the compaction of the entire molecule. In addition, to accommodate the stresses induced by ATP binding at the early transition stage, partial unfoldings (cracking) and reformations of several native contacts occur at the interfaces between the secondary structure motifs enveloping the binding pocket. This suggests that the enzyme experiences local structural deformations while reaching its functional, ATP-bound state. Our dynamical view of the ligand-induced transitions in PKA suggests that the kinetic hierarchy of local and global dynamics, the variable fluctuation of residues and the necessity of partial local unfolding may be fundamental components in other large scale allosteric transitions.},

	Abstract = {Large volumes of protein sequence and structure data acquired by proteomic studies led to the development of computational bioinformatic techniques that made possible the functional annotation and structural characterization of proteins based on their primary structure. It has become evident from genome-wide analyses that many proteins in eukaryotic cells are either completely disordered or contain long unstructured regions that are crucial for their biological functions. The content of disorder increases with evolution indicating a possibly important role of disorder in the regulation of cellular systems. Transcription factors are no exception and several proteins of this class have recently been characterized as premolten/molten globules. Yet, mammalian cells rely on these proteins to control expression of their 30,000 or so genes. Basic region:leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding proteins constitute a major class of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. This review discusses how conformational flexibility "built" into the amino acid sequence allows bZIP proteins to interact with a large number of diverse molecular partners and to accomplish their manifold cellular tasks in a strictly regulated and coordinated manner.},

Upstream signals remodel this landscape, causing signaling proteins to transmit information to downstream partners. New methods provide insight into the dynamic properties of signaling proteins at the atomic scale. The next stages in the signaling hierarchy-how multiple signals are integrated and how cellular signaling pathways are organized in space and time-present exciting challenges for the future, requiring bold multidisciplinary approaches.},

@article{mittag:09,
	Abstract = {Recognition requires protein flexibility because it facilitates conformational rearrangements and induced-fit mechanisms upon target binding. Intrinsic disorder is an extreme on the continuous spectrum of possible protein dynamics and its role in recognition may seem counterintuitive. However, conformational disorder is widely found in many eukaryotic regulatory proteins involved in processes such as signal transduction and transcription. Disordered protein regions may in fact confer advantages over folded proteins in binding. Rapidly interconverting and diverse conformers may create mean electrostatic fields instead of presenting discrete charges. The resultant "polyelectrostatic" interactions allow for the utilization of post-translational modifications as a means to change the net charge and thereby modify the electrostatic interaction of a disordered region. Plasticity of disordered protein states enables steric advantages over folded proteins and allows for unique binding configurations. Disorder may also have evolutionary advantages, as it facilitates alternative splicing, domain shuffling and protein modularity. As proteins exist in a continuous spectrum of disorder, so do their complexes. Indeed, disordered regions in complexes may control the degree of motion between domains, mask binding sites, be targets of post-translational modifications, permit overlapping binding motifs, and enable transient binding of different binding partners, making them excellent candidates for signal integrators and explaining their prevalence in eukaryotic signaling pathways. "Dynamic" complexes arise if more than two transient protein interfaces are involved in complex formation of two binding partners in a dynamic equilibrium. "Disordered" complexes, in contrast, do not involve significant ordering of interacting protein segments but rely exclusively on transient contacts. The nature of these interactions is not well understood yet but advancements in the structural characterization of disordered states will help us gain insights into their function and their implications for health and disease.

	Abstract = {Proteins often have multiple functional states, which might not always be accommodated by a single fold. Lymphotactin (Ltn) adopts two distinct structures in equilibrium, one corresponding to the canonical chemokine fold consisting of a monomeric three-stranded beta-sheet and carboxyl-terminal helix. The second Ltn structure solved by NMR reveals a dimeric all-beta-sheet arrangement with no similarity to other known proteins. In physiological solution conditions, both structures are significantly populated and interconvert rapidly. Interconversion replaces long-range interactions that stabilize the chemokine fold with an entirely new set of tertiary and quaternary contacts. The chemokine-like Ltn conformation is a functional XCR1 agonist, but fails to bind heparin. In contrast, the alternative structure binds glycosaminoglycans with high affinity but fails to activate XCR1. Because each structural species displays only one of the two functional properties essential for activity in vivo, the conformational equilibrium is likely to be essential for the biological activity of lymphotactin. These results demonstrate that the functional repertoire and regulation of a single naturally occurring amino acid sequence can be expanded by access to a set of highly dissimilar native-state structures.},

We find a strong correlation between phosphorylation-driven activation of the signaling protein NtrC and microsecond time-scale backbone dynamics. Using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation, we characterized the motions of NtrC in three functional states: unphosphorylated (inactive), phosphorylated (active), and a partially active mutant. These dynamics are indicative of exchange between inactive and active conformations. Both states are populated in unphosphorylated NtrC, and phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium toward the active species. These results support a dynamic population shift between two preexisting conformations as the underlying mechanism of activation.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a newly recognized class of functional proteins for which a lack of stable tertiary fold is required for function. Because of the heterogeneous and dynamical nature, molecular modeling is necessary to provide the missing details of disordered states of IDP that are crucial for understanding their functions. In particular, generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent, combined with replica exchange (REX), might offer an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency for modeling IDPs. We carried out extensive REX simulations in an optimized GB force field to characterize the disordered states of a regulatory IDP, KID domain of transcription factor CREB, and its phosphorylated form, pKID. The results revealed that both KID and pKID, though highly disordered on the tertiary level, are compact and mainly occupy a small number of helical substates. Interestingly, although phosphorylation of KID Ser133 leads only to marginal changes in average helicities on the ensemble level, underlying conformational substates differ significantly. In particular, pSer133 appears to restrict the accessible conformational space of the loop region and thus reduces the entropic cost of KID folding upon binding to the KIX domain of CREB-binding protein. Such an expanded role of phosphorylation in the KID:KIX recognition was not previously recognized because of a lack of substantial conformational changes on the ensemble level and inaccessibility of the structural details from experiments. The results also suggest that an implicit solvent-based modeling framework, despite various existing limitations, might be feasible for accurate atomistic simulation of small IDPs in general.},

	Abstract = {The interactions between cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and gene-specific transcription factors play an important role in activation of transcription from numerous genes. Cooperative interactions between CBP and multiple transcriptional activators may provide a mechanism for synergistic increases in transcriptional activation. Here we report the characterization of ternary complexes formed by the KIX domain of CBP and the transactivation domain of the trithorax group protein mixed lineage leukemia protein (MLL), together with either the phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain (pKID) of CREB or the activation domain from c-Myb. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments show that KIX in complex with the MLL activation domain binds the c-Myb activation domain and pKID domain with 2-fold higher affinity than does the KIX domain alone. Thus, the activation domains of Myb and MLL or of pKID and MLL bind cooperatively to KIX. The thermodynamics of these interactions imply different mechanisms of binding cooperativity for the two ternary complexes; the KIX.MLL.pKID complex is stabilized by entropy increases, whereas the enhancement of Myb binding in the presence of the MLL activation domain is due to more favorable enthalpy. NMR experiments show that the MLL-binding site on KIX is distinct from the surface that binds the pKID and c-Myb activation domains. Our data indicate that KIX can directly mediate cooperative interactions between pairs of transcriptional regulatory proteins. In the case of MLL and c-Myb, both proteins are involved in proliferation of hematopoietic cells and leukemogenesis, and synergistic interactions mediated by CBP may play a functional role.},

	Abstract = {The hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb activates transcription of target genes through direct interactions with the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. The solution structure of the KIX domain in complex with the activation domain of c-Myb reveals a helical structure very similar to that adopted by KIX in complex with the phosphorylated kinase inducible domain (pKID) of CREB. While pKID contains two helices, alphaA and alphaB, which interact with KIX, the structure of bound c-Myb reveals a single bent amphipathic helix that binds in the same hydrophobic groove as the alphaB helix of pKID. The affinity of c-Myb for KIX is lower than that of pKID, and relies more heavily on optimal interactions of the single helix of c-Myb with residues in the hydrophobic groove. In particular, a deep hydrophobic pocket in KIX accounts for more than half the interactions with c-Myb observed by NMR. A bend in the alpha-helix of c-Myb enables a critical leucine side-chain to penetrate into this pocket more deeply than the equivalent leucine residue of pKID. The components that mediate the higher affinity of pKID for KIX, i.e. the phosphate group and the alphaA helix, are absent from c-Myb. Results from isothermal titration calorimetry, together with the structural data, point to a key difference between the two complexes in optimal pH for binding, as a result of differential pH-dependent interactions with histidine residues of KIX. These results explain the structural and thermodynamic basis for the observed constitutive versus inducible activation properties of c-Myb and CREB.},

The helical content in the alphaB region is very small in the non-phosphorylated form (approximately 10\%) although a small increase is detected upon Ser133 phosphorylation.

	Abstract = {The mechanism of long-range coupling of allosteric sites in calcium-saturated calmodulin (CaM) has been explored by characterizing structural and dynamics effects of mutants of calmodulin in complex with a peptide corresponding to the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase calmodulin-binding domain (smMLCKp). Four CaM mutants were examined: D95N and D58N, located in Ca2+-binding loops; and M124L and E84K, located in the target domain-binding site of CaM. Three of these mutants have altered allosteric coupling either between Ca2+-binding sites (D58N and D95N) or between the target- and Ca2+-binding sites (E84K). The structure and dynamics of the mutant calmodulins in complex with smMLCKp were characterized using solution NMR. Analysis of chemical shift perturbations was employed to detect largely structural perturbations. 15N and 2H relaxation was employed to detect perturbations of the dynamics of the backbone and methyl-bearing side chains of calmodulin. The least median squares method was found to be robust in the detection of perturbed sites. The main chain dynamics of calmodulin are found to be largely unresponsive to the mutations. Three mutants show significantly perturbed dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains. Despite the pseudosymmetric location of Ca2+-binding loop mutations D58N and D95N, the dynamic response of CaM is asymmetric, producing long-range perturbation in D58N and almost none in D95N. The mutations located at the target domain-binding site have quite different effects. For M124L, a local perturbation of the methyl dynamics is observed, while the E84K mutation produces a long-range propagation of dynamic perturbations along the target domain-binding site.},

	Abstract = {Conformational transitions underlie the function of many biomolecular systems. Resolving intermediate structural changes, however, is challenging for both experiments and all-atom simulations because the duration of transitions is short relative to the lifetime of the stable species. Simplified descriptions based on a single experimental structure, such as elastic network models or G{\=o} models, are not immediately applicable. Here, we develop a general method that combines multiple coarse-grained models to capture slow conformational transitions. Individually, each model describes one of the experimental structures; together, they approximate the complete energy surface. We demonstrate the method for the helix-to-sheet transition in Arc repressor N11L. We find that the transition involves the partial unfolding of the switch region, and rapid refolding into the alternate structure. Transient local unfolding is consistent with the low hydrogen exchange protection factors of the switch region. Also in agreement with experiment, the isomerization occurs independently of the global folding/dimerization transition.},

	Abstract = {A microscopic theory of the free energy barriers and folding routes for minimally frustrated proteins is presented, greatly expanding on the presentation of the variational approach outlined previously [J. J. Portman, S. Takada, and P. G. Wolynes, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5237 (1998)]. We choose the lambda -repressor protein as an illustrative example and focus on how the polymer chain statistics influence free energy profiles and partially ordered ensembles of structures. In particular, we investigate the role of chain stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes. We evaluate the applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the protein molecule along the folding route are restricted to have residues that are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches. We find that the folding routes obtained from only one contiguous folded region corresponds to a chain with a much greater persistence length than appropriate for natural protein chains, while the folding route obtained from two contiguous folded regions is able to capture the relatively folded regions calculated within the variational approach. The free energy profiles obtained from the contiguous sequence approximations have larger barriers than the more microscopic variational theory which is understood as a consequence of partial ordering.

	Abstract = {Intrachain contact formation rates, fundamental to the dynamics of biopolymer self-organization such as protein folding, can be monitored in the laboratory through fluorescence quenching measurements. The common approximations for the intrachain contact rate given by the theory of Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten (SSS) [J. Chem. Phys. 72, 4350 (1980)] and Wilemski-Fixman (WF) [J. Chem. Phys. 60, 878 (1973)] are shown to be complementary variational bounds: The SSS and WF approximations are lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the mean first contact times. As reported in the literature, the SSS approximation requires an effective diffusion coefficient 10 to 100 times smaller than expected to fit experimentally measured quenching rates. An all atom molecular dynamics simulation of an eleven residue peptide sequence in explicit water is analyzed to investigate the source of this surprising parameter value. The simulated diffusion limited contact time is approximate to6 ns for a reaction radius of 4 Angstrom for solvent viscosity corresponding to that of water at 293 K and 1 atm (eta=1.0 cP). In analytical work, the polymer is typically modeled by a Gaussian chain of effective monomers. Compared to Gaussian dynamics, the simulated end-to-end distance autocorrelation has a much slower relaxation. The long time behavior of the distance autocorrelation function can be approximated by a Gaussian model in which the monomer diffusion coefficient D-0 is reduced to D-0/6. This value of the diffusion coefficient brings the mean end-to-end contact time from analytical approximations and simulation into agreement in the sense that the SSS and WF approximations bracket the simulated mean first contact time.

	Abstract = {Allostery involves coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites. The common view holds that allosteric proteins are symmetric oligomers, with each subunit existing in "at least" two conformational states with a different affinity for ligands. Recent observations such as the allosteric behavior of myoglobin, a classical example of a nonallosteric protein, call into question the existing allosteric dogma. Here we argue that all (nonfibrous) proteins are potentially allosteric. Allostery is a consequence of re-distributions of protein conformational ensembles. In a nonallosteric protein, the binding site shape may not show a concerted second-site change and enzyme kinetics may not reflect an allosteric transition. Nevertheless, appropriate ligands, point mutations, or external conditions may facilitate a population shift, leading a presumably nonallosteric protein to behave allosterically. In principle, practically any potential drug binding to the protein surface can alter the conformational redistribution. The question is its effectiveness in the redistribution of the ensemble, affecting the protein binding sites and its function. Here, we review experimental observations validating this view of protein allostery.},

	Abstract = {A combination of thirty-two 10-ns-scale molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the coupling between conformational transition and phosphorylation in the bacteria chemotaxis Y protein (CheY), as a simple but representative example of protein allostery. Results from these simulations support an activation mechanism in which the beta4-alpha4 loop, at least partially, gates the isomerization of Tyr106. The roles of phosphorylation and the conserved Thr87 are deemed indirect in that they stabilize the active configuration of the beta4-alpha4 loop. The indirect role of the activation event (phosphorylation) and/or conserved residues in stabilizing, rather than causing, specific conformational transition is likely a feature in many signaling systems. The current analysis of CheY also helps to make clear that neither the "old" (induced fit) nor the "new" (population shift) views for protein allostery are complete, because they emphasize the kinetic (mechanistic) and thermodynamic aspects of allosteric transitions, respectively. In this regard, an issue that warrants further analysis concerns the interplay of concerted collective motion and sequential local structural changes in modulating cooperativity between distant sites in biomolecules.},

	Abstract = {We used nuclear magnetic resonance data to determine ensembles of conformations representing the structure and dynamics of calmodulin (CaM) in the calcium-bound state (Ca(2+)-CaM) and in the state bound to myosin light chain kinase (CaM-MLCK). These ensembles reveal that the Ca(2+)-CaM state includes a range of structures similar to those present when CaM is bound to MLCK. Detailed analysis of the ensembles demonstrates that correlated motions within the Ca(2+)-CaM state direct the structural fluctuations toward complex-like substates. This phenomenon enables initial ligation of MLCK at the C-terminal domain of CaM and induces a population shift among the substates accessible to the N-terminal domain, thus giving rise to the cooperativity associated with binding. Based on these results and the combination of modern free energy landscape theory with classical allostery models, we suggest that a coupled equilibrium shift mechanism controls the efficient binding of CaM to a wide range of ligands.},

	Abstract = {Although phenomenlogical models that account for cooperativity in allosteric systems date back to the early and mid-60's (e.g., the KNF and MWC models), there is resurgent interest in the topic due to the recent experimental and computational studies that attempted to reveal, at an atomistic level, how allostery actually works. In this review, using systems for which atomistic simulations have been carried out in our groups as examples, we describe the current understanding of allostery, how the mechanisms go beyond the classical MWC/Pauling-KNF descriptions, and point out that the "new view" of allostery, emphasizing "population shifts," is, in fact, an "old view." The presentation offers not only an up-to-date description of allostery from a theoretical/computational perspective, but also helps to resolve several outstanding issues concerning allostery.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factors and other allosteric cell signaling proteins contain a disproportionate number of domains or segments that are intrinsically disordered (ID) under native conditions. In many cases folding of these segments is coupled to binding with one or more of their interaction partners, suggesting that intrinsic disorder plays an important functional role. Despite numerous hypotheses for the role of ID domains in regulation, a mechanistic model has yet to be established that can quantitatively assess the importance of intrinsic disorder for intramolecular site-to-site communication, the hallmark property of allosteric proteins. Here, we present such a model and show that site-to-site allosteric coupling is maximized when intrinsic disorder is present in the domains or segments containing one or both of the coupled binding sites. This result not only explains the prevalence of ID domains in regulatory proteins, it also calls into question the classical mechanical view of energy propagation in proteins, which predicts that site-to-site coupling would be maximized when a well defined pathway of folded structure connects the two sites. Furthermore, in showing that the coupling mechanism conferred by intrinsic disorder is robust and independent of the network of interactions that physically link the coupled sites, unique insights are gained into the energetic ground rules that govern site-to-site communication in all proteins.},

@article{levy:05,
	Abstract = {Many cellular functions rely on interactions between protein pairs and higher oligomers. We have recently shown that binding mechanisms are robust and owing to the minimal frustration principle, just as for protein folding, are governed primarily by the protein's native topology, which is characterized by the network of non-covalent residue-residue interactions. The detailed binding mechanisms of nine dimers, a trimer, and a tetramer, each involving different degrees of flexibility and plasticity during assembly, are surveyed here using a model that is based solely on the protein topology, having a perfectly funneled energy landscape. The importance of flexibility in binding reactions is manifested by the fly-casting effect, which is diminished in magnitude when protein flexibility is removed. Many of the grosser and finer structural aspects of the various binding mechanisms (including binding of pre-folded monomers, binding of intrinsically unfolded monomers, and binding by domain-swapping) predicted by the native topology based landscape model are consistent with the mechanisms found in the laboratory. An asymmetric binding mechanism is often observed for the formation of the symmetric homodimers where one monomer is more structured at the binding transition state and serves as a template for the folding of the other monomer. Phi values were calculated to show how the structure of the binding transition state ensemble would be manifested in protein engineering studies. For most systems, the simulated Phi values are reasonably correlated with the available experimental values. This agreement suggests that the overall binding mechanism and the nature of the binding transition state ensemble can be understood from the network of interactions that stabilize the native fold. The Phi values for the formation of an antibody-antigen complex indicate a possible role for solvation of the interface in biomolecular association of large rigid proteins.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin is a central mediator of calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways and regulates the activity of a large number of diverse targets. Calcium-dependent interactions of calmodulin with regulated proteins are of generally high affinity but of quite variable thermodynamic origins. Here we investigate the influence of the binding of the calmodulin-binding domain of calmodulin kinase I on the fast internal dynamics of calcium-saturated calmodulin. NMR relaxation was used to probe motion on the backbone (viewed through the backbone amide NH group) and the side chains (viewed through methyl groups). The distribution of the amplitudes of side chain dynamics is trimodal. The microscopic details of side chain motion are compared with those of a thermodynamically and structurally similar complex of calmodulin with the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. While there are no significant differences in backbone dynamics and no net change in methyl-bearing side chain dynamics, a large redistribution of the amplitude of methyl dynamics is observed between the two complexes. The variation in dynamics was largely localized to the heterogeneously dynamic target-binding interface, suggesting that differential dynamics of the binding surface plays a functional role in the high-affinity binding interactions of calmodulin. These results begin to reveal a fundamental role for residual protein entropy in molecular recognition by calmodulin.},

	Abstract = {All-atom, explicit water molecular dynamics simulations of calcium-loaded calmodulin complexed with a peptide corresponding to the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase target were carried out at 295 and 346 K. Amide and side chain methyl angular generalized order parameters were calculated and analyzed in the context of the protein's structure and dynamics. The agreement between amide order parameters measured by NMR and those from the simulations was found to be good, especially at the higher temperature, indicating both better convergence for the latter and excellent transferrability of the CHARMM parameters to the higher temperature. Subtle dynamical features such as helix fraying were reproduced. A large range of order parameters for the nine calmodulin methionines was observed in the NMR, and reproduced quite well in the simulations. The major determinant of the methionine order parameter was found to be the proximity to side chains of aromatic residues. An upper bound estimate of the difference in backbone entropy between loop and helical regions was extracted from the order parameters using a model of motion in an effective potential. Although loop regions are more flexible than helical regions, it was found that the entropy loss per residue upon folding was only approximately 20\% less for loops than for helices. Pairwise correlated motions, which could significantly lower entropy estimates obtained from order parameter analysis alone, were found to be largely absent.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a second messenger protein that has evolved to bind tightly to a variety of targets and, as such, exhibits low binding specificity. We redesigned CaM by using a computational protein design algorithm to improve its binding specificity for one of its targets, smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK). Residues in or near the CaM/smMLCK binding interface were optimized; CaM interactions with alternative targets were not directly considered in the optimization. The predicted CaM sequences were constructed and tested for binding to a set of eight targets including smMLCK. The best CaM variant, obtained from a calculation that emphasized intermolecular interactions, showed up to a 155-fold increase in binding specificity. The increase in binding specificity was not due to improved binding to smMLCK, but due to decreased binding to the alternative targets. This finding is consistent with the fact that the sequence of wild-type CaM is nearly optimal for interactions with numerous targets.},

Hence, these observations validate the proposition that binding and folding are similar processes. In both packing plays a critical role, rationalizing the residue conservation and the experimental alanine scanning hot spots.

Temperature-induced Monte Carlo simulations of p27(Kip1) unfolding-unbinding carried out from the crystal structure of the tertiary complex have revealed a systematic trend in the hierarchy of structural loss for p27(Kip1) and a considerable difference in mobility of p27(Kip1) secondary structure elements. The most persistent interactions of p27(Kip1) at the intermolecular interface during unfolding-unbinding simulations are formed by beta-hairpin and beta-strand that on average maintain their structural integrity considerably longer than other p27(Kip1) elements. We have found that the ensemble of unfolded p27(Kip1) conformations is characterized by transitions between mostly unbound, collapsed conformations and entropically favorable p27(Kip1) conformations, which are weakly bound to the cyclin A side of the binary complex. The results of this study are consistent with the experimental evidence pointing to this region of the intermolecular interface as a potential initiation docking site during binding reaction and may reconcile conflicting experimental hypotheses on the recognition of substrate recruitment motifs.},

Hierarchy of p27(Kip1) structural loss determined in our earlier studies from temperature-induced Monte Carlo simulations and subsequent characterization of the transition state ensemble (TSE) for the folding reaction have shown that simultaneous ordering of the p27(Kip1) native intermolecular interface for the beta-hairpin and beta-strand secondary structure elements is critical for nucleating a rapid kinetic transition to the native tertiary complex. In the present study, we investigate the effect of forming specific intermolecular interactions on structure prediction of the p27(Kip1) tertiary complex. By constraining different secondary structure elements of p27(Kip1) in their native bound conformations and conducting multiple simulated annealing simulations, we analyze differences in the success rate of predicting the native structure of p27(Kip1) in the tertiary complex. In accordance with the nucleation-condensation mechanism, we have found that further stabilization of the native intermolecular interface for the beta-hairpin and beta-strand elements of p27(Kip1), that become ordered in the TSE, but are hardly populated in the unbound state, results in a consistent acquisition of the native bound structure. Conversely, the excessive stablization of the local secondary structure elements, which are rarely detected in the TSE, has a detrimental effect on convergence to the native bound structure.},

	Abstract = {A microscopic study of functional disorder-order folding transitions coupled to binding is performed for the p27 protein, which derives a kinetic advantage from the intrinsically disordered unbound form on binding with the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex. Hierarchy of structural loss during p27 coupled unfolding and unbinding is simulated by using high-temperature Monte Carlo simulations initiated from the crystal structure of the tertiary complex. Subsequent determination of the transition-state ensemble and the proposed atomic picture of the folding mechanism coupled to binding provide a microscopic rationale that reconciles the initiation recruitment of p27 at the cyclin A docking site with the kinetic benefit for a disordered alpha-helix in the unbound form of p27. The emerging structural polarization in the ensemble of unfolding/unbinding trajectories and in the computationally determined transition-state ensemble is not determined by the intrinsic folding preferences of p27 but rather is attributed to the topological requirements of the native intermolecular interface to order beta-hairpin and beta-strand of p27 that could be critical for nucleating rapid folding transition coupled to binding. In agreement with the experimental data, the disorder-order folding transition for p27 is largely determined by the functional requirement to form a specific intermolecular interface that ultimately dictates the folding mechanism and overwhelms any local folding preferences for creating a stable alpha-helix in the p27 structure before overcoming the major free energy barrier.},

	Abstract = {p27(Kip1) contributes to cell-cycle regulation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. The p27 Cdk-inhibition domain has an ordered conformation comprising an alpha-helix, a 3(10) helix, and beta-structure when bound to cyclin A-Cdk2. In contrast, the unbound p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is intrinsically disordered (natively unfolded) as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy, lack of chemical-shift dispersion, and negative heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects. The intrinsic disorder is not due to the excision of the Cdk-inhibition domain from p27, since circular dichroism spectra of the full-length protein are also indicative of a largely unfolded protein. Both the inhibition domain and full-length p27 are active as cyclin A-Cdk2 inhibitors. Using circular dichroism and proline mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the unbound p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is not completely unfolded. The domain contains marginally stable helical structure that presages the alpha-helix, but not the 3(10) helix, adopted upon binding cyclin A-Cdk2. Increasing or reducing the stability of the partially preformed alpha-helix in the isolated p27 domain with alanine or proline substitutions did not affect formation of the p27-inhibited cyclin A-Cdk2 complex in energetic terms. However, stabilization of the helix with alanine hindered kinetically the formation of the inhibited complex, suggesting that p27 derives a kinetic advantage from intrinsic structural disorder.},

	Abstract = {Protein recognition and binding, which result in either transient or long-lived complexes, play a fundamental role in many biological functions, but sometimes also result in pathologic aggregates. We use a simplified simulation model to survey a range of systems where two highly flexible protein chains form a homodimer. In all cases, this model, which corresponds to a perfectly funneled energy landscape for folding and binding, reproduces the macroscopic experimental observations on whether folding and binding are coupled in one step or whether intermediates occur. Owing to the minimal frustration principle, we find that, as in the case of protein folding, the native topology is the major factor that governs the choice of binding mechanism. Even when the monomer is stable on its own, binding sometimes occurs fastest through unfolded intermediates, thus showing the speedup envisioned in the fly-casting scenario for molecular recognition.},

For the first time, the detection of single copies of cameleon immobilized in agarose gels is described. This work exemplifies the issues involved in the observation of binding kinetics at the single-molecule level, using fluorescence resonant energy transfer as a signature of the response of the system to the presence of Ca2+ ions. The energy transfer distribution deduced from single-molecule fluorescence signals shows an increased width at the Ca2+ dissociation constant concentration, which is consistent with the ligand binding kinetics. The complex dynamics of the fluctuations are examined using a combination of autocorrelation and cross-correlation in conjunction with polarization information. We find both negative and positive cross-correlations in the donor and acceptor emission signals, the former related to the energy transfer process, and the latter caused by other perturbations of the donor and acceptor emission.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin is a calcium-signaling protein that is involved in a diverse range of biological pathways. The flexibility of the two lobes of CaM about a central linker domain is crucial to target recognition and binding. We have attached fluorescent probes to the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CaM. In this study, we report single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two domains. We have detected fluctuations in single-molecule FRET efficiency on the microsecond and millisecond time scales by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The cross-correlation decay due to FRET on the 100 mus time scale is sensitive to the Ca2+ concentration, with similar relaxation at a saturating Ca2+ concentration of 100 muM and in the absence of Ca2+, but distinctly slower relaxation in the presence of 1 muM Ca2+. We have also measured the FRET efficiency distribution by analysis of fluorescence bursts in solution. The distributions of single-molecule FRET efficiencies reveal the existence of multiple conformations in solution. At least two distinct conformations are detected and attributed to distinct configurations of the N- and C-terminal domains about the central linker of CaM. These distributions are confirmed by time-resolved ensemble FRET measurements. In addition, FCS yields the diffusion coefficient for CaM. We discuss in detail issues involved in analysis of single-molecule FRET measurements, including analysis of signals and the nature and effect of dye interactions with the protein.},

	Abstract = {Multiple-quantum spin relaxation is a sensitive probe for correlated conformational exchange dynamics on microsecond to millisecond time scales in biomolecules. We measured differential 1H-15N multiple-quantum relaxation rates for the backbone amide groups of the E140Q mutant of the C-terminal domain of calmodulin at three static magnetic field strengths. The differential multiple-quantum relaxation rates range between -88.7 and 92.7 s(-1), and the mean and standard deviation are 7.0 +/- 24 s(-1), at a static magnetic field strength of 14.1 T. Together with values of the 1H and 15N chemical shift anisotropies (CSA) determined separately, the field-dependent data enable separation of the different contributions from dipolar-dipolar, CSA-CSA, and conformational exchange cross-correlated relaxation mechanisms to the differential multiple-quantum relaxation rates. The procedure yields precise quantitative information on the dominant conformational exchange contributions observed in this protein. The field-dependent differences between double- and zero-quantum relaxation rates directly benchmark the rates of conformational exchange, showing that these are fast on the chemical shift time scale for the large majority of residues in the protein. Further analysis of the differential 1H-15N multiple-quantum relaxation rates using previously determined exchange rate constants and populations, obtained from 15N off-resonance rotating-frame relaxation data, enables extraction of the product of the chemical shift differences between the resonance frequencies of the 1H and 15N spins in the exchanging conformations, deltasigma(H)deltasigma(N). Thus, information on the 1H chemical shift differences is obtained, while circumventing complications associated with direct measurements of conformational exchange effects on 1H single-quantum coherences in nondeuterated proteins. The method significantly increases the information content available for structural interpretation of the conformational exchange process, partly because deltasigma(H)deltasigma(N) is a signed quantity, and partly because two chemical shifts are probed simultaneously. The present results support the hypothesis that the exchange in the calcium-loaded state of the E140Q mutant involves conformations similar to those of the wild-type apo (closed) and calcium-loaded (open) states.},

	Abstract = {A 20-ns molecular dynamics simulation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM) in explicit solvent is described. Within 5 ns, the extended crystal structure adopts a compact shape similar in dimension to complexes of CaM and target peptides but with a substantially different orientation between the N- and C-terminal domains. Significant interactions are observed between the terminal domains in this compact state, which are mediated through the same regions of CaM that bind to target peptides derived from protein kinases and most other target proteins. The process of compaction is driven by the loss of helical structure in two separate regions between residues 75-79 and 82-86, the latter being driven by unfavorable electrostatic interactions between acidic residues. In the first 5 ns of the simulation, a substantial number of contacts are observed between the first helix of the N-terminal domain and residues 74-77 of the central linker. These contacts are correlated with the closing of the second EF-hand, indicating a mechanism by which they can lower calcium affinity in the N-terminal domain.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics studies of the N-domain (amino acids 1-77; CaM(1-77)) of Ca2+-loaded calmodulin (CaM) show that a solvent exposed hydrophobic cleft in the crystal structure of CaM exhibits transitions from an exposed (open) to a buried (closed) state over a time scale of nanoseconds. As a consequence of burying the hydrophobic cleft, the R(g) of the protein is reduced by 1.5 A. Based on this prediction, x-ray scattering experiments were conducted on this domain over a range of concentrations. Models built from the scattering data show that the R(g) and general shape is consistent with the simulation studies of CaM(1-77). Based on these observations we postulate a model in which the conformation of CaM fluctuates between two different states that expose and bury this hydrophobic cleft. In aqueous solution the closed state dominates the population, while in the presence of peptides, the open state dominates. This inherent flexibility of CaM may be the key to its versatility in recognizing structurally distinct peptide sequences. This model conflicts with the currently accepted hypothesis based on observations in the crystal structure, where upon Ca2+ binding the hydrophobic cleft is exposed to solvent. We postulate that crystal packing forces stabilize the protein conformation toward the open configuration.},

The removal of Ca2+ causes the interhelical angles of four EF-hand motifs to increase by 36 degrees-44 degrees. This leads to major changes in surface properties, including the closure of the deep hydrophobic cavity essential for target protein recognition. Concerted movements of helices A and D with respect to B and C, and of helices E and H with respect to F and G are likely responsible for the cooperative Ca(2+)-binding property observed between two adjacent EF-hand sites in the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains.},

In the absence of Ca2+, the four helices in each of the two globular domains form a highly twisted bundle, capped by a short anti-parallel beta-sheet.

	Abstract = {A 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation of calcium-free calmodulin in solution has been performed, using Ewald summation to treat electrostatic interactions. Our simulation results were mostly consistent with solution experimental studies, including NMR, fluorescence and x-ray scattering. The secondary structures within the N- and C-terminal domains were conserved in the simulation, with trajectory structures similar to the NMR-derived model structure 1CFD. However, the relative orientations of the domains, for which there are no NMR restraints, differed in details between the simulation and the 1CFD model. The most interesting information provided by the simulations is that the dynamics of calcium-free calmodulin in solution is dominated by slow rigid body reorientations of the domains. The interdomain distance fluctuated between 29 and 39 A, and interdomain orientation angle, defined as the pseudo-dihedral formed by the four calcium binding sites, varied between -2 degrees and 108 degrees. Similarly, the domain linker region also exhibited significant fluctuations, with its length varying in the 34-45 A range and its bend angle in the 10-100 degrees range. The simulations are in accord with fluorescence results suggesting that calcium-free calmodulin is more compact and more flexible than the calcium activated form. Surprisingly, quite similar solvent accessibilities of the hydrophobic patches were seen in the calcium-free trajectory described in this work and previously generated calcium-loaded calmodulin simulations. Thus, our simulations suggest a reexamination of the standard model of the structural change of calmodulin upon calcium binding, involving exposure of the hydrophobic patches to solvent.},

	Abstract = {The conformational space sampled by the two-domain protein calmodulin has been explored by an approach based on four sets of NMR observables obtained on Tb(3+)- and Tm(3+)-substituted proteins. The observables are the pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings of the C-terminal domain when lanthanide substitution is at the N-terminal domain. Each set of observables provides independent information on the conformations experienced by the molecule. It is found that not all sterically allowed conformations are equally populated. Taking the N-terminal domain as the reference, the C-terminal domain preferentially resides in a region of space inscribed in a wide elliptical cone. The axis of the cone is tilted by approximately 30 degrees with respect to the direction of the N-terminal part of the interdomain helix, which is known to have a flexible central part in solution. The C-terminal domain also undergoes rotation about the axis defined by the C-terminal part of the interdomain helix. Neither the extended helix conformation initially observed in the solid state for free calcium calmodulin nor the closed conformation(s) adopted by calcium calmodulin either alone or in its adduct(s) with target peptide(s) is among the most preferred ones. These findings are unique, both in terms of structural information obtained on a biomolecule that samples multiple conformations and in terms of the approach developed to achieve the results. The same approach is in principle applicable to other multidomain proteins, as well as to multiple interaction modes between two macromolecular partners.},

	Abstract = {The interpretation of NMR relaxation data for macromolecules possessing slow interdomain motions is considered. It is shown how the "extended model-free approach" can be used to analyze (15)N backbone relaxation data acquired at three different field strengths for Xenopus Ca(2+)-ligated calmodulin. This protein is comprised of two domains connected by two rigid helices joined by a flexible segment. It is possible to uniquely determine all "extended model-free" parameters without any a priori assumptions regarding their magnitudes by simultaneously least-squares fitting the relaxation data measured at two different magnetic fields. It is found that the two connecting helices (and consequently the domains) undergo slow motions relative to the conformation in which the two helices are parallel. The time scales and amplitudes of these "wobbling" motions are characterized by effective correlation times and squared-order parameters of approximately 3 ns and 0.7, respectively. These values are consistent with independent estimates indicating that this procedure provides a useful first-order description of complex internal motions in macromolecules despite neglecting the coupling of overall and interdomain motions.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between the peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light-chain kinase and (Ca2+)4-calmodulin has been studied by multinuclear and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The study was facilitated by the use of 15N-labeled peptide in conjunction with 15N-edited and 15N-correlated 1H spectroscopy. The peptide forms a 1:1 complex with calcium-saturated calmodulin which is in slow exchange with free peptide. The 1H and 15N resonances of the bound have been assigned. An extensive set of structural constraints for the bound peptide has been assembled from the analysis of nuclear Overhauser effects and three-bond coupling constants. The backbone conformation of the bound peptide has been determined using these constraints by use of distance geometry and related computational methods. The backbone conformation of the peptide has been determined to high precision and is generally indicative of helical secondary structure. Nonhelical backbone conformations are seen in the middle and at the C-terminal end of the bound peptide. These studies provide the first direct confirmation of the amphiphilic helix model for the structure of peptides bound to calcium-saturated calmodulin.},

	Abstract = {Calcium-containing calmodulin (CaM) and its complex with a peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase [skMLCK(576-594)G] have been studied by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR techniques. Resonances arising from the antiparallel beta-sheet structures associated with the calcium-binding domains of CaM and their counterparts in the CaM-skMLCK(576-594)G complex have been assigned. The assignments were initiated by application of the main chain directed assignment strategy. It is found that, despite significant changes in chemical shifts of resonances arising from amino acid residues in this region upon binding of the peptide, the beta-sheets have virtually the same structure in the complex as in CaM. Hydrogen exchange rates of amide NH within the beta-sheet structures are significantly slowed upon binding of peptide. These data, in conjunction with the observed nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns and relative intensities and the downfield shifts of associated amide and alpha resonances upon binding of peptide, show that the peptide stabilizes the Ca2+-bound state of calmodulin. The observed pattern of NOEs within the beta-sheets and their structural similarity correspond closely to those predicted by the crystal structure. These findings imply that the apparent inconsistency of the crystal structure with recently reported low-angle X-ray scattering profiles of CaM may lie within the putative central helix bridging the globular domains.},

	Abstract = {Amide hydrogen exchange has been used to examine the structural dynamics and energetics of the interaction of a peptide corresponding to the calmodulin binding domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase with calcium-saturated calmodulin. Heteronuclear NMR 15N-1H correlation techniques were used to quantitate amide proton exchange rates of both 15N-labeled and unlabeled amide protons of the smMLCK peptide complexed to calmodulin. Hydrogen exchange slowing factors were determined for 18 of the 19 amide hydrogens and found to span 6 orders of magnitude. The first six residues of the bound peptide were found to have slowing factors near 1 and are considered not to be hydrogen bonded, consistent with the previously reported model for the structure of the peptide. The pattern of hydrogen exchange of hydrogen-bonded amide hydrogens is indicative of end-fraying behavior characteristic of helix-coil transitions. The effective statistical mechanical parameters revealed by the end fraying are consistent with exchange from a highly solvated state. However, the slowing factors of the first hydrogen-bonded amide hydrogens are large, indicating the requirement for a reorganization of the calmodulin-peptide complex before the helix-coil transitions leading to exchange can occur. Taken together, these observations suggest that the collapsed complex reorganizes with an associated free energy change of 5.5 kcal/mol to a more open state where the helical peptide is highly solvated and undergoes helix-coil transitions leading to exchange. The free energy difference between the most and least stable intrahelical amide hydrogen bonds of the bound peptide is estimated to be approximately 2.5 kcal/mol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Heteronuclear NMR (15)N-(1)H correlation spectroscopy was used to quantify amide proton exchange rates of the uniformly (15)N-labeled domain bound to calmodulin. A key feature of a proposed model for molecular recognition by calmodulin [Ehrhardt et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2731-2738] is tested by examination of the dependence of amide hydrogen exchange on applied hydrostatic pressure. Hydrogen exchange rates and corresponding protection factors (1/K(op)) for individual amide protons of the bound smMLCKp domain span 5 orders of magnitude at ambient pressure. Individual protection factors decrease significantly in a linear fashion with increasing hydrostatic pressure. A common pressure dependence is revealed by a constant large negative volume change across the residues comprising the core of the bound helical domain. The pattern of protection factors and their response to hydrostatic pressure is consistent with a structural reorganization that results in the concerted disruption of ion pairs between calmodulin and the bound domain. These observations reinforce a model for the molecular recognition pathway where formation of the initial encounter complex is followed by helix-coil transitions in the bound state and subsequent concerted formation of the extensive ion pair network defining the intermolecular contact surface between CaM and the target domain in the final, compact complex structure.},

Using heteronuclear NMR (13)C-(15)N-(1)H correlation experiments, the backbone assignments were determined for CaM bound to a peptide (CaMKIp) corresponding to the CaM-binding sequence of CaMKI. A comparison of chemical shifts for free CaM with those of the CaM.CaMKIp complex indicate large differences throughout the CaM sequence. Using NMR techniques optimized for large proteins, backbone resonance assignments were also determined for CaM bound to the intact CaMKI enzyme. NMR spectra of CaM bound to either the CaMKI enzyme or peptide are virtually identical, indicating that calmodulin is structurally indistinguishable when complexed to the intact kinase or the peptide CaM-binding domain. Chemical shifts of CaM bound to a peptide (smMLCKp) corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase are also compared with the CaM.CaMKI complexes. Chemical shifts can differentiate one complex from another, as well as bound versus free states of CaM. In this context, the observed similarity between CaM.CaMKI enzyme and peptide complexes is striking, indicating that the peptide is an excellent mimetic for interaction of calmodulin with the CaMKI enzyme.},

	Abstract = {The temperature dependence of the fast internal dynamics of calcium-saturated calmodulin in complex with a peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is examined using 15N and 2H NMR relaxation methods. NMR relaxation studies of the complex were carried out at 13 temperatures that span 288-346 K. The dynamics of the backbone and over four dozen methyl-bearing side chains, distributed throughout the calmodulin molecule, were probed. The side chains show a much more variable and often considerably larger response to temperature than the backbone. A significant variation in the temperature dependence of the amplitude of motion of individual side chains is seen. The amplitude of motion of some side chains is essentially temperature-independent while many show a simple roughly linear temperature dependence. In a few cases, angular order increases with temperature, which is interpreted as arising from interactions with neighboring residues. In addition, a number of side chains display a nonlinear temperature dependence. The significance of these and other results is illuminated by several simple interpretative models. Importantly, analysis of these models indicates that changes in generalized order parameters can be robustly related to corresponding changes in residual entropy. A simple cluster model that incorporates features of cooperative or conditional motion reproduces many of the unusual features of the experimentally observed temperature dependence and illustrates that side chain interactions result in a dynamically changing environment that significantly influences the motion of internal side chains. This model also suggests that the intrinsic entropy of interacting clusters of side chains is only modestly reduced from that of independent side chain motion. Finally, estimates of protein heat capacity support the view that the major contribution to the heat capacity of protein solutions largely arises from local bond vibrations and solvent interactions and not from torsional oscillations of side chains.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is an intracellular calcium-binding protein essential for many pathways in eukaryotic signal transduction. Although a structure of Ca(2+)-saturated Paramecium CaM at 1.0 A resolution (1EXR.pdb) provides the highest level of detail about side-chain orientations in CaM, information about an end state alone cannot explain driving forces for the transitions that occur during Ca(2+)-induced conformational switching and why the two domains of CaM are saturated sequentially rather than simultaneously. Recent studies focus attention on the contributions of interdomain linker residues. Electron paramagnetic resonance showed that Ca(2+)-induced structural stabilization of residues 76-81 modulates domain coupling [Qin and Squier (2001) Biophys. J. 81, 2908-2918]. Studies of N-domain fragments of Paramecium CaM showed that residues 76-80 increased thermostability of the N-domain but lowered the Ca(2+) affinity of sites I and II [Sorensen et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15-20]. To probe domain coupling during Ca(2+) binding, we have used (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR to monitor more than 40 residues in Paramecium CaM. The titrations demonstrated that residues Glu78 to Glu84 (in the linker and cap of helix E) underwent sequential phases of conformational change. Initially, they changed in volume (slow exchange) as sites III and IV titrated, and subsequently, they changed in frequency (fast exchange) as sites I and II titrated. These studies provide evidence for Ca(2+)-dependent communication between the domains, demonstrating that spatially distant residues respond to Ca(2+) binding at sites I and II in the N-domain of CaM.},

	Abstract = {The fast dynamics of protein backbones are often investigated by nuclear magnetic relaxation experiments that report on the degree of spatial restriction of the amide bond vector. By comparing calmodulin in the peptide-bound and peptide-free states with these classical methods, we observe little difference in the dynamics of the polypeptide main chain (average order parameter decrease of 0.01 unit upon binding). However, when using NMR methods that monitor the mobility of the CO-Calpha bond vector, we reveal a significant reduction of dynamics of the protein main chain (average order parameter decrease of 0.048 units). Previous investigations have suggested that the side-chain dynamics is reduced by an average of 0.07 order parameter units upon ligand binding (Lee, A. L.; Kinnear, S. A.; Wand, A. J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000, 7, 72-77). The current findings suggest that the change of the CO-Calpha bond vector dynamics is intermediate between the changes in NH and side-chain dynamics and report a previously undetected loss of main-chain entropy. Weak site-to-site correlations between the different motional indicators are also observed.},

Here, we report the backbone and side-chain methyl dynamics of calcium-activated calmodulin in complex with a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of calmodulin kinase kinase, along with the thermodynamic underpinnings of complex formation. The results show a considerable reduction in side-chain mobility throughout CaM upon binding the CaMKKalpha peptide, which is consistent with the enthalpically driven nature of the binding. Site-specific comparison to another kinase-derived peptide complex with similar thermodynamic values reveals significant differences in dynamics largely localized to the hydrophobic binding sites.},

	Abstract = {Molecular recognition by proteins is fundamental to almost every biological process, particularly the protein associations underlying cellular signal transduction. Understanding the basis for protein-protein interactions requires the full characterization of the thermodynamics of their association. Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally estimate changes in protein conformational entropy, a potentially important component of the free energy of protein association. However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Here we employ changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for corresponding changes in conformational entropy. We find that the change in internal dynamics of the protein calmodulin varies significantly on binding a variety of target domains. Surprisingly, the apparent change in the corresponding conformational entropy is linearly related to the change in the overall binding entropy. This indicates that changes in protein conformational entropy can contribute significantly to the free energy of protein-ligand association.},

We propose an allosteric model for calmodulin activation, in which binding to calcium facilitates the transition between a low-affinity [tense (T)] and a high-affinity [relaxed (R)] state. The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of CaMKII and PP2B depending on calcium concentration.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-binding protein that can regulate a wide variety of cellular events. The protein contains 9 Met out of a total of 148 amino acid residues. The binding of Ca2+ to CaM induces conformational changes and exposes two Met-rich hydrophobic surfaces which provide the main protein-protein contact areas when CaM interacts with its target enzymes. Two-dimensional (1H,13C)-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR spectroscopy was used to study selectively 13C-isotope labelled Met methyl groups in apo-CaM, Ca(2+)-CaM and a complex of CaM with the CaM-binding domain of skeletal muscle Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK). The resonance assignment of the Met methyl groups in these three functionally different states were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Met-->Leu). Chemical shift changes indicate that the methyl groups of the Met residues are in different environments in apo-, calcium-, and MLCK-bound-CaM. The T1 relaxation rates of the individual Met methyl carbons in the three forms of CaM indicate that those in Ca(2+)-CaM have the highest mobility. Our results also suggest that the methyl groups of the unbranched Met sidechains in general are more flexible than those of aliphatic amino acid residues such as Leu and Ile.},

	Abstract = {The backbone dynamics of Ca(2+)-saturated recombinant Drosophila calmodulin has been studied by 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation experiments, combined with 15N(1H) NOE measurements. Results indicate a high degree of mobility near the middle of the central helix of calmodulin, from residue K77 through S81, with order parameters (S2) in the 0.5-0.6 range. The anisotropy observed in the motion of the two globular calmodulin domains is much smaller than expected on the basis of hydrodynamic calculations for a rigid dumbbell type structure. This indicates that, for the purposes of 15N relaxation, the tumbling of the N-terminal (L4-K77) and C-terminal (E82-S147) lobes of calmodulin is effectively independent. A slightly shorter motional correlation time (tau c approximately 6.3 ns) is obtained for the C-terminal domain compared to the N-terminal domain (tau c approximately 7.1 ns), in agreement with the smaller size of the C-terminal domain. A high degree of mobility, with order parameters of approximately 0.5, is also observed in the loop that connects the first with the second EF-hand type calcium binding domain and in the loop connecting the third and fourth calcium binding domain.},

	Abstract = {The solution structure of Ca(2+)-ligated calmodulin is determined from residual dipolar couplings measured in a liquid crystalline medium and from a large number of heteronuclear J couplings for defining side chains. Although the C-terminal domain solution structure is similar to the X-ray crystal structure, the EF hands of the N-terminal domain are considerably less open. The substantial differences in interhelical angles correspond to negligible changes in short interproton distances and, therefore, cannot be identified by comparison of NOEs and X-ray data. NOE analysis, however, excludes a two-state equilibrium in which the closed apo conformation is partially populated in the Ca(2+)-ligated state. The difference between the crystal and solution structures of Ca(2+)-calmodulin indicates considerable backbone plasticity within the domains of calmodulin, which is key to their ability to bind a wide range of targets. In contrast, the vast majority of side chains making up the target binding surface are locked into the same chi(1) rotameric states as in complexes with target peptide.},

	Abstract = {Thermodynamic parameters of interactions of calcium-saturated calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) with melittin, C-terminal fragment of melittin, or peptides derived from the CaM binding regions of constitutive (cerebellar) nitric-oxide synthase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, and caldesmon (CaD-A, CaD-A*) have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. The peptides could be separated into two groups according to the change in heat capacity upon complex formation, DeltaC(p). The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, constitutive (cerebellar) nitric-oxide synthase, and melittin peptides have DeltaC(p) values clustered around -3.2 kJ.mol(-1).K(-1), consistent with the formation of a globular CaM-peptide complex in the canonical fashion. In contrast, phosphodiesterase, the C-terminal fragment of melittin, CaD-A, and CaD-A* have DeltaC(p) values clustered around -1.6 kJ.mol(-1).K(-1), indicative of interactions between the peptide and mostly one lobe of CaM, probably the C-terminal lobe. It is also shown that the interactions for different peptides with Ca(2+)-CaM can be either enthalpically or entropically driven. The difference in the energetics of peptide/Ca(2+)-CaM complex formation appears to be due to the coupling of peptide/Ca(2+)-CaM complex formation to the coil-helix transition of the peptide. The binding of a helical peptide to Ca(2+)-CaM is dominated by favorable entropic effects, which are probably mostly due to hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar groups of the peptide and Ca(2+)-CaM. Applications of these findings to the design of potential CaM inhibitors are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous, essential calcium-binding protein that regulates diverse protein targets in response to physiological calcium fluctuations. Most high-resolution structures of CaM-target complexes indicate that the two homologous domains of CaM are equivalent partners in target recognition. However, mutations between calcium-binding sites I and II in the N-domain of Paramecium calmodulin (PCaM) selectively affect calcium-dependent sodium currents. To understand these domain-specific effects, N-domain fragments (PCaM(1-75)) of six of these mutants were examined to determine whether energetics of calcium binding to sites I and II or conformational properties had been perturbed. These PCaM((1-75)) sequences naturally contain 5 Phe residues but no Tyr or Trp; calcium binding was monitored by observing the reduction in intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence at 280 nm. To assess mutation-induced conformational changes, thermal denaturation of the apo PCaM((1-75)) sequences, and calcium-dependent changes in Stokes radii were determined. The free energy of calcium binding to each mutant was within 1 kcal/mole of the value for wild type and calcium reduced the R(s) of all of them. A striking trend was observed whereby mutants showing an increase in calcium affinity and R(s) had a concomitant decrease in thermal stability (by as much as 18 degrees C). Thus, mutations between the binding sites that increased disorder and reduced tertiary constraints in the apo state promoted calcium coordination. This finding underscores the complexity of the linkage between calcium binding and conformational change and the difficulty in predicting mutational effects.},

	Abstract = {Chemical and thermal denaturation of calmodulin has been monitored spectroscopically to determine the stability for the intact protein and its two isolated domains as a function of binding of Ca2+ or Mg2+. The reversible urea unfolding of either isolated apo-domain follows a two-state mechanism with relatively low deltaG(o)20 values of approximately 2.7 (N-domain) and approximately 1.9 kcal/mol (C-domain). The apo-C-domain is significantly unfolded at normal temperatures (20-25 degrees C). The greater affinity of the C-domain for Ca2+ causes it to be more stable than the N-domain at [Ca2+] > or = 0.3 mM. By contrast, Mg2+ causes a greater stabilization of the N- rather than the C-domain, consistent with measured Mg2+ affinities. For the intact protein (+/-Ca2+), the bimodal denaturation profiles can be analyzed to give two deltaG(o)20 values, which differ significantly from those of the isolated domains, with one domain being less stable and one domain more stable. The observed stability of the domains is strongly dependent on solution conditions such as ionic strength, as well as specific effects due to metal ion binding. In the intact protein, different folding intermediates are observed, depending on the ionic composition. The results illustrate that a protein of low intrinsic stability is liable to major perturbation of its unfolding properties by environmental conditions and liganding processes and, by extension, mutation. Hence, the observed stability of an isolated domain may differ significantly from the stability of the same structure in a multidomain protein. These results address questions involved in manipulating the stability of a protein or its domains by site directed mutagenesis and protein engineering.},

	Abstract = {Intramolecular melting of troponin C, calmodulin and their proteolytic fragments has been studied microcalorimetrically at various concentrations of monovalent and divalent ions. It is shown by thermodynamic analysis of the experimentally determined excess heat capacity function that the four calcium-binding domains in these two related proteins are not integrated into a single co-operative system, as would be the case if they formed a common hydrophobic core in the molecule, but still interact with each other in a very specific way. There is a positive interaction between domains I and II, which is so strong that they actually form a single co-operative block. The interaction between domains III and IV is positive also, although much less pronounced, while the interaction between the pairs of domains (I and II) and (III and IV) is negative, as if they repel each other. The structure of the co-operative block of domains I and II at room temperature does not depend noticeably on the ionic conditions, which influence its stability to a small extent only. The same applies to domain IV of calmodulin, but in troponin C this domain is unstable in the absence of divalent ions, in solutions of low ionic strength. In both proteins, the least stable is domain III, which forms a compact ordered structure at room temperature only in the presence of Ca2+. In troponin C, calcium ions can be replaced by magnesium ions, although the compact structure of domain III formed by these two ions does not seem to be quite identical. Thus, at conditions close to physiological, with regard to temperature and ionic strength, the removal of free Ca2+ from the solution induces in both proteins a reversible transition of domain III to the non-compact disordered state. This dramatic Ca2+-induced change in the domain III conformation in troponin C and calmodulin might play a key role in the functioning of these proteins as a Ca2+-controlled switch in the molecular mechanisms of living systems.},

	Abstract = {The experimental material accumulated in the literature on the conformational behavior of intrinsically unstructured (natively unfolded) proteins was analyzed. Results of this analysis showed that these proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected for members of a single thermodynamic entity. Rather, these proteins may be divided into two structurally different groups: intrinsic coils, and premolten globules. Proteins from the first group have hydrodynamic dimensions typical of random coils in poor solvent and do not possess any (or almost any) ordered secondary structure. Proteins from the second group are essentially more compact, exhibiting some amount of residual secondary structure, although they are still less dense than native or molten globule proteins. An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they undergo disorder-order transition during or prior to their biological function. In this respect, the Protein Quartet model, with function arising from four specific conformations (ordered forms, molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils) and transitions between any two of the states, is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding and binding are analogous processes, in which the protein 'searches' for favourable intramolecular or intermolecular interactions on a funnelled energy landscape. Many eukaryotic proteins are disordered under physiological conditions, and fold into ordered structures only on binding to their cellular targets. The mechanism by which folding is coupled to binding is poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds that the binding kinetics may be enhanced by a 'fly-casting' effect, where the disordered protein binds weakly and non-specifically to its target and folds as it approaches the cognate binding site. Here we show, using NMR titrations and (15)N relaxation dispersion, that the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain (pKID) of the transcription factor CREB forms an ensemble of transient encounter complexes on binding to the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. The encounter complexes are stabilized primarily by non-specific hydrophobic contacts, and evolve by way of an intermediate to the fully bound state without dissociation from KIX. The carboxy-terminal helix of pKID is only partially folded in the intermediate, and becomes stabilized by intermolecular interactions formed in the final bound state. Future applications of our method will provide new understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins perform their diverse biological functions.},

	Abstract = {Many cellular proteins are intrinsically disordered and undergo folding, in whole or in part, upon binding to their physiological targets. The past few years have seen an exponential increase in papers describing characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins, both free and bound to targets. Although NMR spectroscopy remains the favored tool, a number of new biophysical techniques are proving exceptionally useful in defining the limits of the conformational ensembles. Advances have been made in prediction of the recognition elements in disordered proteins, in elucidating the kinetics and mechanism of the coupled folding and binding process, and in understanding the role of post-translational modifications in tuning the biological response. Here we review these and other recent advances that are providing new insights into the conformational propensities and interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins and are beginning to reveal general principles underlying their biological functions.},

	Abstract = {For well-structured, rigid proteins, the prediction of rotational tumbling time (tau(c)) using atomic coordinates is reasonably accurate, but is inaccurate for proteins with long unstructured sequences. Under physiological conditions, many proteins contain long disordered segments that play important regulatory roles in fundamental biological events including signal transduction and molecular recognition. Here we describe an ensemble approach to the boundary element method that accurately predicts tau(c) for such proteins by introducing two layers of molecular surfaces whose correlated velocities decay exponentially with distance. Reliable prediction of tau(c) will help to detect intra- and intermolecular interactions and conformational switches between more ordered and less ordered states of the disordered segments. The method has been extensively validated using 12 reference proteins with 14 to 103 disordered residues at the N- and/or C-terminus and has been successfully employed to explain a set of published results on a system that incorporates a conformational switch.},

@article{wright:99,
	Abstract = {A major challenge in the post-genome era will be determination of the functions of the encoded protein sequences. Since it is generally assumed that the function of a protein is closely linked to its three-dimensional structure, prediction or experimental determination of the library of protein structures is a matter of high priority. However, a large proportion of gene sequences appear to code not for folded, globular proteins, but for long stretches of amino acids that are likely to be either unfolded in solution or adopt non-globular structures of unknown conformation. Characterization of the conformational propensities and function of the non-globular protein sequences represents a major challenge. The high proportion of these sequences in the genomes of all organisms studied to date argues for important, as yet unknown functions, since there could be no other reason for their persistence throughout evolution. Clearly the assumption that a folded three-dimensional structure is necessary for function needs to be re-examined. Although the functions of many proteins are directly related to their three-dimensional structures, numerous proteins that lack intrinsic globular structure under physiological conditions have now been recognized. Such proteins are frequently involved in some of the most important regulatory functions in the cell, and the lack of intrinsic structure in many cases is relieved when the protein binds to its target molecule. The intrinsic lack of structure can confer functional advantages on a protein, including the ability to bind to several different targets. It also allows precise control over the thermodynamics of the binding process and provides a simple mechanism for inducibility by phosphorylation or through interaction with other components of the cellular machinery. Numerous examples of domains that are unstructured in solution but which become structured upon binding to the target have been noted in the areas of cell cycle control and both transcriptional and translational regulation, and unstructured domains are present in proteins that are targeted for rapid destruction. Since such proteins participate in critical cellular control mechanisms, it appears likely that their rapid turnover, aided by their unstructured nature in the unbound state, provides a level of control that allows rapid and accurate responses of the cell to changing environmental conditions.},

In this model, the energy basins corresponding to known conformers are connected at their lowest common energies. The results are used to evaluate and analyze the minimal energy pathways between these basins. The open to closed transition analysis provides an identification of hinges that is in agreement with the existing definitions based on the available X-ray structures. The elastic energy distribution and the C(alpha) pseudo-dihedral variation provide similar information on these hinges. The ensemble of the 45 published structures for this protein and closely related proteins is shown to always be within 3.0 A of the pathway, which corresponds to a conformational change between two end structures that differ by a C(alpha)-atom root-mean-squared deviation of 7.1A.},

	Abstract = {We develop a mixed elastic network model (MENM) to study large-scale conformational transitions of proteins between two (or more) known structures. Elastic network potentials for the beginning and end states of a transition are combined, in effect, by adding their respective partition functions. The resulting effective MENM energy function smoothly interpolates between the original surfaces, and retains the beginning and end structures as local minima. Saddle points, transition paths, potentials of mean force, and partition functions can be found efficiently by largely analytic methods. To characterize the protein motions during a conformational transition, we follow "transition paths" on the MENM surface that connect the beginning and end structures and are invariant to parameterizations of the model and the mathematical form of the mixing scheme. As illustrations of the general formalism, we study large-scale conformation changes of the motor proteins KIF1A kinesin and myosin II. We generate possible transition paths for these two proteins that reveal details of their conformational motions. The MENM formalism is computationally efficient and generally applicable even for large protein systems that undergo highly collective structural changes.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factors are central components of the intracellular regulatory networks that control gene expression. An increasingly recognized phenomenon among human transcription factors is the formation of structure upon target binding. Here, we study the folding and binding of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. Our simulations of a topology-based G{\=o}-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially bound intermediates. From transition-path and Phi-value analyses, we find that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. A change of structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism and contrasts with models in which binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting"-like process. We find that the inclusion of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. Our study helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition. The simulations are in general agreement with the results of a recently reported nuclear magnetic resonance study, and aid in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics.},

	Abstract = {In this work, a double-well network model (DWNM) is presented for generating a coarse-grained free energy function that can be used to study the transition between reference conformational states of a protein molecule. Compared to earlier work that uses a single, multidimensional double-well potential to connect two conformational states, the DWNM uses a set of interconnected double-well potentials for this purpose. The DWNM free energy function has multiple intermediate states and saddle points, and is hence a ``rough'' free energy landscape. In this implementation of the DWNM, the free energy function is reduced to an elastic-network model representation near the two reference states. The effects of free energy function roughness on the reaction pathways of protein conformational change is demonstrated by applying the DWNM to the conformational changes of two protein systems: the coil-to-helix transition of the DB-loop in G-actin and the open-to-closed transition of adenylate kinase. In both systems, the rough free energy function of the DWNM leads to the identification of distinct minimum free energy paths connecting two conformational states. These results indicate that while the elastic-network model captures the low-frequency vibrational motions of a protein, the roughness in the free energy function introduced by the DWNM can be used to characterize the transition mechanism between protein conformations.},

	Abstract = {Conformational heterogeneity in proteins is known to often be the key to their function. We present a coarse grained model to explore the interplay between protein structure, folding and function which is applicable to allosteric or non-allosteric proteins. We employ the model to study the detailed mechanism of the reversible conformational transition of Adenylate Kinase (AKE) between the open to the closed conformation, a reaction that is crucial to the protein's catalytic function. We directly observe high strain energy which appears to be correlated with localized unfolding during the functional transition. This work also demonstrates that competing native interactions from the open and closed form can account for the large conformational transitions in AKE. We further characterize the conformational transitions with a new measure ΦFunc, and demonstrate that local unfolding may be due, in part, to competing intra-protein interactions.},

	Abstract = {The computational sampling of rare, large-scale, conformational transitions in proteins is a well appreciated challenge-for which a number of potentially efficient path-sampling methodologies have been proposed. Here, we study a large-scale transition in a united-residue model of calmodulin using the "weighted ensemble" (WE) approach of Huber and Kim. Because of the model's relative simplicity, we are able to compare our results with brute-force simulations. The comparison indicates that the WE approach quantitatively reproduces the brute-force results, as assessed by considering (i) the reaction rate, (ii) the distribution of event durations, and (iii) structural distributions describing the heterogeneity of the paths. Importantly, the WE method is readily applied to more chemically accurate models, and by studying a series of lower temperatures, our results suggest that the WE method can increase efficiency by orders of magnitude in more challenging systems.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of adenylate kinase of Escherichia coli (AKeco) and its complex with the inhibitor AP(5)A, are characterized by correlating the theoretical results obtained with the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and the anisotropic network model (ANM) with the order parameters and correlation times obtained with Slowly Relaxing Local Structure (SRLS) analysis of (15)N-NMR relaxation data. The AMPbd and LID domains of AKeco execute in solution large amplitude motions associated with the catalytic reaction Mg(+2)*ATP + AMP --> Mg(+2)*ADP + ADP. Two sets of correlation times and order parameters were determined by NMR/SRLS for AKeco, attributed to slow (nanoseconds) motions with correlation time tau( perpendicular) and low order parameters, and fast (picoseconds) motions with correlation time tau( parallel) and high order parameters. The structural connotation of these patterns is examined herein by subjecting AKeco and AKeco*AP(5)A to GNM analysis, which yields the dynamic spectrum in terms of slow and fast modes. The low/high NMR order parameters correlate with the slow/fast modes of the backbone elucidated with GNM. Likewise, tau( parallel) and tau( perpendicular) are associated with fast and slow GNM modes, respectively. Catalysis-related domain motion of AMPbd and LID in AKeco, occurring per NMR with correlation time tau( perpendicular), is associated with the first and second collective slow (global) GNM modes. The ANM-predicted deformations of the unliganded enzyme conform to the functional reconfiguration induced by ligand-binding, indicating the structural disposition (or potential) of the enzyme to bind its substrates. It is shown that NMR/SRLS and GNM/ANM analyses can be advantageously synthesized to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that control biological function.},

@article{tama:02,
	Abstract = {Normal mode analysis based on a simplified energy function was used to study the swelling process of the icosahedral virus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV). Native state virus particles (coat proteins) of this T=3 icosahedral virus have been shown to undergo a large conformational change to a swollen state when metal ions are removed or the pH is raised. A normal mode analysis based on the native state capsid showed one preferential direction, a breathing mode, that explains the majority of the structural rearrangement necessary to bring the native structure close to the swollen state. From the native form of CCMV, the structure can be displaced along the direction of a single breathing mode by different amounts to create several candidate swollen structures and a putative pathway for virus expansion. The R-factor between these predicted swollen capsid structures and experimental electron density from cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) measurements is then calculated to indicate how well each structure satisfies the experimental measurements on the swollen capsid state. A decrease of the crystallographic R-factor value from approximately 72\% to approximately 49\% was observed for these simple incremental displacements along the breathing mode. The simultaneous displacement of the native structure along other relevant (symmetric, non-degenerate) modes produce a structure with an R-factor of 45\%, which is further reduced to 43.9\% after minimization: a value in good accord with models based on the EM data at 28 A resolution. Based on the incrementally expanded structures, a pathway for the swelling process has been proposed. Analysis of the intermediate structures along this pathway indicates a significant loss of interactions at the quasi-3-fold interfaces occurs in the initial stages of the swelling process and this serves as a trigger for the compact to swollen transition. Furthermore, the pH dependent swelling appears to be triggered by the titration of a single residue with an anomalous pK(a) value in the unswollen particle.},

	Abstract = {Recently we have developed a normal-modes-based algorithm that predicts the direction of protein conformational changes given the initial state crystal structure together with a small number of pairwise distance constraints for the end state. Here we significantly extend this method to accurately model both the direction and amplitude of protein conformational changes. The new protocol implements a multisteps search in the conformational space that is driven by iteratively minimizing the error of fitting the given distance constraints and simultaneously enforcing the restraint of low elastic energy. At each step, an incremental structural displacement is computed as a linear combination of the lowest 10 normal modes derived from an elastic network model, whose eigenvectors are reorientated to correct for the distortions caused by the structural displacements in the previous steps. We test this method on a list of 16 pairs of protein structures for which relatively large conformational changes are observed (root mean square deviation >3 angstroms), using up to 10 pairwise distance constraints selected by a fluctuation analysis of the initial state structures. This method has achieved a near-optimal performance in almost all cases, and in many cases the final structural models lie within root mean square deviation of 1 approximately 2 angstroms from the native end state structures.},

	Abstract = {The number of solved structures of macromolecules that have the same fold and thus exhibit some degree of conformational variability is rapidly increasing. It is consequently advantageous to develop a standardized terminology for describing this variability and automated systems for processing protein structures in different conformations. We have developed such a system as a 'front-end' server to our database of macromolecular motions. Our system attempts to describe a protein motion as a rigid-body rotation of a small 'core' relative to a larger one, using a set of hinges. The motion is placed in a standardized coordinate system so that all statistics between any two motions are directly comparable. We find that while this model can accommodate most protein motions, it cannot accommodate all; the degree to which a motion can be accommodated provides an aid in classifying it. Furthermore, we perform an adiabatic mapping (a restrained interpolation) between every two conformations. This gives some indication of the extent of the energetic barriers that need to be surmounted in the motion, and as a by-product results in a 'morph movie'. We make these movies available over the Web to aid in visualization. Many instances of conformational variability occur between proteins with somewhat different sequences. We can accommodate these differences in a rough fashion, generating an 'evolutionary morph'. Users have already submitted hundreds of examples of protein motions to our server, producing a comprehensive set of statistics. So far the statistics show that the median submitted motion has a rotation of approximately 10 degrees and a maximum Calpha displacement of 17 A. Almost all involve at least one large torsion angle change of >140 degrees. The server is accessible at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale. edu/MolMovDB},

Catastrophe theory enables us to describe how the geometry of the surface changes with parameters in the potential, and provides universal scaling relations that explain, for example, the asymmetric reaction profiles observed for systems bound by long-range forces. The principal result is an unexpected connection between barrier heights, path lengths, and vibrational frequencies, with applications to a wide variety of problems in chemical physics, ranging from Hammond's postulate in organic chemistry, to the relaxation dynamics of complex systems such as glasses and biomolecules.},

This is demonstrated by using a simple procedure to reduce the native structures of the 41 two-state proteins with native TCD as a constraint, and is further supported by analyzing the results of eight proteins from protein engineering studies. These results support the hypothesis that the major rate-limiting process in the folding of small apparently two-state proteins is the search for a critical number of residues with the topology close to that of the native state.},

	Abstract = {The relative folding rates of simple, single-domain proteins, proteins whose folding energy landscapes are smooth, are highly dispersed and strongly correlated with native-state topology. In contrast, the relative folding rates of small, G{\=o}-potential lattice polymers, which also exhibit smooth energy landscapes, are poorly dispersed and insignificantly correlated with native-state topology. Here, we investigate this discrepancy in light of a recent, quantitative theory of two-state folding kinetics, the topomer search model. This model stipulates that the topology-dependence of two-state folding rates is a direct consequence of the extraordinarily cooperative equilibrium folding of simple proteins. We demonstrate that traditional G{\=o} polymers lack the extreme cooperativity that characterizes the folding of naturally occurring, two-state proteins and confirm that the folding rates of a diverse set of G{\=o} 27-mers are poorly dispersed and effectively uncorrelated with native state topology. Upon modestly increasing the cooperativity of the G{\=o}-potential, however, significantly increased dispersion and strongly topology-dependent kinetics are observed. These results support previous arguments that the cooperative folding of simple, single-domain proteins gives rise to their topology-dependent folding rates. We speculate that this cooperativity, and thus, indirectly, the topology-rate relationship, may have arisen in order to generate the smooth energetic landscapes upon which rapid folding can occur.},

	Abstract = {Most small, single-domain proteins fold with the uncomplicated, single-exponential kinetics expected for diffusion on a smooth energy landscape. Despite this energetic smoothness, the folding rates of these two-state proteins span a remarkable million-fold range. Here, we review the evidence in favor of a simple, mechanistic description, the topomer search model, which quantitatively accounts for the broad scope of observed two-state folding rates. The model, which stipulates that the search for those unfolded conformations with a grossly correct topology is the rate-limiting step in folding, fits observed rates with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.9 using just two free parameters. The fitted values of these parameters, the pre-exponential attempt frequency and a measure of the difficulty of ordering an unfolded chain, are consistent with previously reported experimental constraints. These results suggest that the topomer search process may dominate the relative barrier heights of two-state protein-folding reactions.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical studies have suggested relationships between the size, stability and topology of a protein fold and the rate and mechanisms by which it is achieved. The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.},

	Abstract = {It is evident that protein conformational transitions play important roles in biological machinery; however, detailed pictures of these transition processes capable of making kinetic prediction are not yet available. For a full description of these transitions, we first need to describe kinematically movements between stable states. Then, more importantly, a free energy profile associated with the conformational change needs to be obtained. Recently, a new model to describe the energy landscape of protein conformational changes was applied to the conformational transition of adenylate kinase. In this model, the conformational change coupled to the ligand binding is described as a switching between two energy surfaces that correspond to ligand bound and unbound states. The nonlinearity of the protein conformational changes is described through an iterative usage of normal mode calculations. In addition, another kind of nonlinearity enters the dynamics of the conformational transitions due to cracking, or partial unfolding, which may occur during the conformational transitions. The consequences of this theoretical model are explored in greater detail. An improved model for the cracking that includes the cooperativity of the partial unfolding in analogy to nucleation is introduced.},

When seeming deviations from the predictions of the funnel hypothesis are found, landscape theory helps us locate the cause. Sometimes the deviation reflects symmetry effects, allowing extra degeneracies to occur. Such effects seem to explain some kinetic anomalies in helical bundles. When binding processes were found to use apparently non-funneled landscapes this was traced to an inadequate understanding of biomolecular forces. The discrepancy allowed the discovery of new water-mediated forces - some of which act between hydrophilic residues. Introducing such forces into the algorithms greatly improves the quality of structure predictions.},

Kern and-coworkers (Wolf-Watzet al., 2004; Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007a, 2007b) have shown that insights about functionally relevant motions that determine the overall enzyme turnover rate can be obtained by investigating conformational dynamics around the equilibrium basin of the enzyme adenylate kinase. An allosteric change in protein structure turns out to be the controlling process. In this commentary we compare results of this study with earlier predictions of the route by which the enzyme undergoes its conformational change. These predictions are based on the idea that the energy surface for the protein is determined by the end structures of the conformational change. A key issue is whether the protein moves by specific hinges or whether it "cracks" and accesses partially unfolded states during its structural change.},

	Abstract = {Small, single-module proteins that fold in a single cooperative step may be paradigms for understanding early events in protein-folding pathways generally. Recent experimental studies of the 64-residue chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) support a nucleation mechanism for folding, as do some computer stimulations. CI2 has a nucleation site that develops only in the transition state for folding. The nucleus is composed of a set of adjacent residues (an alpha-helix), stabilized by long-range interactions that are formed as the rest of the protein collapses around it. A simple analysis of the optimization of the rate of protein folding predicts that rates are highest when the denatured state has little residual structure under physiological conditions and no intermediates accumulate. This implies that any potential nucleation site that is composed mainly of adjacent residues should be just weakly populated in the denatured state and become structured only in a high-energy intermediate or transition state when it is stabilized by interactions elsewhere in the protein. Hierarchical mechanisms of folding in which stable elements of structure accrete are unfavorable. The nucleation-condensation mechanism of CI2 fulfills the criteria for fast folding. On the other hand, stable intermediates do form in the folding of more complex proteins, and this may be an unavoidable consequence of increasing size and nucleation at more than one site.},

However, R15 folds and unfolds 3 orders of magnitude faster than R16 and R17. This is unexpected. The rate-limiting transition state for R15 folding is investigated using protein engineering methods (Phi-value analysis) and compared with previously completed analyses of R16 and R17. Characterisation of many mutants suggests that all three proteins have similar complexity in the folding landscape. The early rate-limiting transition states of the three domains are similar in terms of overall structure, but there are significant differences in the patterns of Phi-values. R15 apparently folds via a nucleation-condensation mechanism, which involves concomitant folding and packing of the A- and C-helices, establishing the correct topology. R16 and R17 fold via a more framework-like mechanism, which may impede the search to find the correct packing of the helices, providing a possible explanation for the fast folding of R15.},

The variational method directly yields predicted chevron plots for wild-type and mutant apo-forms of azurin. In parallel, we performed in vitro kinetic-folding experiments on the same set of azurin variants using chemical perturbation. Like the wild-type protein, all apo-variants fold in apparent two-state reactions both in calculations and in stopped-flow mixing experiments. Comparisons of phi (phi) values determined from the experimental and theoretical chevron parameters reveal an excellent agreement for most positions, indicating a polarized, highly structured TSE for folding of P. aeruginosa apo-azurin. We also demonstrate that careful analysis of side-chain interactions is necessary for appropriate theoretical description of core mutants.},

The functional directly yields predicted chevron plots both for the wild-type protein and for various mutants. The detailed variations of the TSE and changes in chevron plots predicted by the theory agree reasonably well with the results of the experiments.

	Abstract = {The structural difference in proteins between unbound and bound forms directly suggests the importance of the conformational plasticity of proteins. However, pathways that connect two-end structures and how they are coupled to the binding reaction are not well understood at atomic resolution. Here, we analyzed the free-energy landscape, explicitly taking into account coupling between binding and conformational change by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for Ca2+ binding to a calmodulin loop. Using the AMBER force field with explicit water solvent, we conducted umbrella sampling for the free-energy surface and steered molecular dynamics for the pathway search. We found that, at an early stage of binding, some key residue side chains extend their "arms" to catch Ca2+ and, after catching, they carry the Ca2+ to the center of the binding pocket. This grabbing motion resulted in smooth and stepwise exchange in coordination partners of Ca2+ from water oxygen to atoms in the calmodulin loop. The key residue that first caught the ion was one of the two acidic residues, which are highly conserved. In the pathway simulations, different pathways were observed between binding and dissociation reactions: The former was more diverse than the latter.},

	Abstract = {Allostery, the coupling between ligand binding and protein conformational change, is the heart of biological network and it has often been explained by two representative models, the induced-fit and the population-shift models. Here, we clarified for what systems one model fits better than the other by performing molecular simulations of coupled binding and conformational change. Based on the dynamic energy landscape view, we developed an implicit ligand-binding model combined with the double-basin Hamiltonian that describes conformational change. From model simulations performed for a broad range of parameters, we uncovered that each of the two models has its own range of applicability, stronger and longer-ranged interaction between ligand and protein favors the induced-fit model, and weaker and shorter-ranged interaction leads to the population-shift model. We further postulate that the protein binding to small ligand tends to proceed via the population-shift model, whereas the protein docking to macromolecules such as DNA tends to fit the induced-fit model.},

	Abstract = {We perform a large-scale study of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins and protein complexes using a non-redundant set of hundreds of different protein complexes. In accordance with the conventional view that folding and binding are coupled, in many of our cases the disorder-to-order transition occurs upon complex formation and can be localized to binding interfaces. Moreover, analysis of disorder in protein complexes depicts a significant fraction of intrinsically disordered regions, with up to one third of all residues being disordered. We find that the disorder in homodimers, especially in symmetrical homodimers, is significantly higher than in heterodimers and offer an explanation for this interesting phenomenon. We argue that the mechanisms of regulation of binding specificity through disordered regions in complexes can be as common as for unbound monomeric proteins. The fascinating diversity of roles of disordered regions in various biological processes and protein oligomeric forms shown in our study may be a subject of future endeavors in this area.},

	Abstract = {An elementary statistical mechanical model was used to calculate the folding rates for 22 proteins from their known three-dimensional structures. In this model, residues come into contact only after all of the intervening chain is in the native conformation. An additional simplifying assumption is that native structure grows from localized regions that then fuse to form the complete native molecule. The free energy function for this model contains just two contributions-conformational entropy of the backbone and the energy of the inter-residue contacts. The matrix of inter-residue interactions is obtained from the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure. For the 18 proteins that exhibit two-state equilibrium and kinetic behavior, profiles of the free energy versus the number of native peptide bonds show two deep minima, corresponding to the native and denatured states. For four proteins known to exhibit intermediates in folding, the free energy profiles show additional deep minima. The calculated rates of folding the two-state proteins, obtained by solving a diffusion equation for motion on the free energy profiles, reproduce the experimentally determined values surprisingly well. The success of these calculations suggests that folding speed is largely determined by the distribution and strength of contacts in the native structure. We also calculated the effect of mutations on the folding kinetics of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, the most intensively studied two-state protein, with some success.},

@article{janin:97,
	Abstract = {We examine a simple kinetic model for association that incorporates the basic features of protein-protein recognition within the rigid body approximation, that is, when no large conformation change occurs. Association starts with random collision at the rate k(coll) predicted by the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation. This creates an encounter pair that can evolve into a stable complex if and only if the two molecules are correctly oriented and positioned, which has a probability p(r). In the absence of long-range interactions, the bimolecular rate of association is p(r) k(coll). Long-range electrostatic interactions affect both k(coll) and p(r). The collision rate is multiplied by q(t), a factor larger than 1 when the molecules carry net charges of opposite sign as coulombic attraction makes collisions more frequent, and less than 1 in the opposite case. The probability p(r) is multiplied by a factor q(r) that represents the steering effect of electric dipoles, which preorient the molecules before they collide. The model is applied to experimental data obtained by Schreiber and Fersht (Nat. Struct. Biol. 3:427-431, 1996) on the kinetics of barnase-barstar association. When long-range electrostatic interactions are fully screened or mutated away, q(t)q(r) approximately 1, and the observed rate of productive collision is p(r) k(coll) approximately 10(5) M(-1) x s(-1). Under these conditions, p(r) approximately 1.5 x 10(-5) is determined by geometric constraints corresponding to a loss of rotational freedom. Its value is compatible with computer docking simulations and implies a rotational entropy loss deltaS(rot) approximately 22 e.u. in the transition state. At low ionic strength, long-range electrostatic interactions accelerate barnase-barstar association by a factor q(t)q(r) of up to 10(5) as favorable charge-charge and charge-dipole interactions work together to make it much faster than free diffusion would allow.},

	Abstract = {The chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli makes use of an extended two-component sensory response pathway in which CheA, an autophosphorylating protein histidine kinase (PHK) rapidly passes its phosphoryl group to CheY, a phospho-accepting response regulator protein (RR). The CheA-->CheY phospho-transfer reaction is 100-1000 times faster than the His-->Asp phospho-relays that operate in other (non-chemotaxis) two-component regulatory systems, suggesting that CheA and CheY have unique features that enhance His-->Asp phospho-transfer kinetics. One such feature could be the P2 domain of CheA. P2 encompasses a binding site for CheY, but an analogous RR-binding domain is not found in other PHKs. In previous work, we removed P2 from CheA, and this decreased the catalytic efficiency of CheA-->CheY phospho-transfer by a factor of 50-100. Here we examined the kinetics of the binding interactions between CheY and P2. The rapid association reaction (k(assn) approximately 10(8)M(-1)s(-1) at 25 degrees C and micro=0.03 M) exhibited a simple first-order dependence on P2 concentration and appeared to be largely diffusion-limited. Ionic strength (micro) had a moderate effect on k(assn) in a manner predictable based on the calculated electrostatic interaction energy of the protein binding surfaces and the expected Debye-H{\"u}ckel shielding. The speed of binding reflects, in part, electrostatic interactions, but there is also an important contribution from the inherent plasticity of the complex and the resulting flexibility that this allows during the process of complex formation. Our results support the idea that the P2 domain of CheA contributes to the overall speed of phospho-transfer by promoting rapid association between CheY and CheA. However, this alone does not account for the ability of the chemotaxis system to operate much more rapidly than other two-component systems: k(cat) differences indicate that CheA and CheY also achieve the chemical events of phospho-transfer more rapidly than do PHK-RR pairs of slower systems.},

Binding to Cdk2-cyclin A is accompanied by p27 folding, and kinetic data suggest a sequential mechanism that is initiated by binding to cyclin A. p27 regulates CDK-cyclin complexes involved directly in cell cycle control and does not interact with other closely related CDKs. We show that p27-cyclin interactions are an important determinant of this specificity and propose that the homologous cell cycle regulators p21 and p57 function by a similar sequential, folding-on-binding mechanism.},

	Abstract = {A polypeptide corresponding to the core/dimerization domain of E. coli Trp repressor (TR), [2-66]2 TR, was constructed by insertion of a pair of stop codons into the trpR gene. The kinetic properties of the urea-induced folding of this core fragment were examined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (FL) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The kinetic response of wild-type TR (WT TR) is very complicated and has been interpreted to involve three parallel channels with multiple folding and isomerization reactions (Mann et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 14573-14580). The refolding of [2-66]2 TR can be described by a much simpler mechanism, involving an association reaction followed by a urea-dependent first-order folding reaction. The second-order rate constant for the association reaction approaches that of the diffusion limit, 3 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 in 1 M urea at 15 degreesC. Double-jump experiments demonstrate that >/=93\% of the unfolded monomers proceed to the native dimer via the dimeric intermediate; several lines of evidence demonstrate that this dimeric species is an on-pathway intermediate. The subsequent first-order folding reaction of the dimeric intermediate to the native species involves development of additional secondary structure and tertiary structure. The kinetic folding mechanism of [2-66]2 TR suggests that: (1) the complexity of the folding kinetics of full-length WT TR arises from alternative interactions of the DNA reading heads with the dimerization core domain-not from the intertwined nature of the dimerization interface; (2) residues 2-66 contain all of the sequence information necessary to direct the near-diffusion-limited association reaction in a TR folding reaction; and (3) the formation of secondary and tertiary structure is concurrent with or precedes dimerization, and further development certainly follows the formation of quaternary structure.},

	Abstract = {To examine whether helix formation necessarily precedes chain collision, we have measured the folding of a fully helical coiled coil that has been specially engineered to have negligible intrinsic helical propensity but high overall stability. The folding rate approaches the diffusion-limited value and is much faster than possible if folding is contingent on precollision helix formation. Therefore, the collision of two unstructured chains is the initial step of the dominant kinetic pathway, whereas helicity exerts its influence only at a later step. Folding from an unstructured encounter complex may be efficient and robust, which has implications for any biological process that couples folding to binding.},

The largest rate constants are for encounter-limited reactions, where association takes place whenever the associating macromolecules collide. Macromolecules that associate through specific binding sites often have much smaller rate constants. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the rate of association for complementary nucleic acid strands can be made encounter limited by attaching weakly associating, relatively unstructured polymeric domains to the nucleic acids involved. These results have led to a model suggesting that similar domains provide a general means of increasing rates of association for specific macromolecular binding partners, both in vivo and in vitro.},

	Abstract = {A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis. The concept of conformational substates has been described; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.},

The dominant kinetic paths of binding and folding can be determined and quantified. The significant coupling between the binding and folding of biomolecules often exists in many important cellular processes. In this case, the corresponding kinetic paths of binding are shown to be intimately correlated with those of folding and the dynamics becomes quite cooperative. This implies that binding and folding happen concurrently. When the coupling between binding and folding is weak (strong), the kinetic process usually starts with significant folding (binding) first, with the binding (folding) later proceeding to the end. The kinetic rate can be obtained through the contributions from the dominant paths. The rate is shown to have a bell-shaped dependence on temperature in the concentration-saturated regime consistent with experiment. The changes of the kinetics that occur upon changing the parameters of the underlying binding-folding energy landscape are studied.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this study is to verify the concept of the funnel-like intermolecular energy landscape in protein-protein interactions by use of a series of computational experiments. Our preliminary analysis revealed the existence of the funnel in many protein-protein interactions. However, because of the uncertainties in the modeling of these interactions and the ambiguity of the analysis procedures, the detection of the funnels requires detailed quantitative approaches to the energy landscape analysis. A number of such approaches are presented in this study. We show that the funnel detection problem is equivalent to a problem of distinguishing between distributions of low-energy intermolecular matches in the funnel and in the low-frequency landscape fluctuations. If the fluctuations are random, the decision about whether the minimum is the funnel is equivalent to determining whether this minimum is significantly different from a would-be random one. A database of 475 nonredundant cocrystallized protein-protein complexes was used to re-dock the proteins by use of smoothed potentials. To detect the funnel, we developed a set of sophisticated models of random matches. The funnel was considered detected if the binding area was more populated by the low-energy docking predictions than by the matches generated in the random models. The number of funnels detected by use of different random models varied significantly. However, the results confirmed that the funnel may be the general feature in protein-protein association.},

	Abstract = {We report the computer generation of a high-density map of the thermodynamic properties of the diffusion-accessible encounter conformations of four receptor-ligand protein pairs, and use it to study the electrostatic and desolvation components of the free energy of association. Encounter complex conformations are generated by sampling the translational/rotational space of the ligand around the receptor, both at 5-A and zero surface-to-surface separations. We find that partial desolvation is always an important effect, and it becomes dominant for complexes in which one of the reactants is neutral or weakly charged. The interaction provides a slowly varying attractive force over a small but significant region of the molecular surface. In complexes with no strong charge complementarity this region surrounds the binding site, and the orientation of the ligand in the encounter conformation with the lowest desolvation free energy is similar to the one observed in the fully formed complex. Complexes with strong opposite charges exhibit two types of behavior. In the first group, represented by barnase/barstar, electrostatics exerts strong orientational steering toward the binding site, and desolvation provides some added adhesion within the local region of low electrostatic energy. In the second group, represented by the complex of kallikrein and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the overall stability results from the rather nonspecific electrostatic attraction, whereas the affinity toward the binding region is determined by desolvation interactions.},

However, in solution proteins exist in a range of conformations, which may be described by statistical mechanical laws and their populations follow statistical distributions. Upon binding, the equilibrium will shift in favor of the bound conformation from the ensemble of conformations around the bottom of the folding funnel. Hence here we extend the implications and the usefulness of the folding funnel concept to explain fundamental binding mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {While the classical view of protein folding kinetics relies on phenomenological models, and regards folding intermediates in a structural way, the new view emphasizes the ensemble nature of protein conformations. Although folding has sometimes been regarded as a linear sequence of events, the new view sees folding as parallel microscopic multi-pathway diffusion-like processes. While the classical view invoked pathways to solve the problem of searching for the needle in the haystack, the pathway idea was then seen as conflicting with Anfinsen's experiments showing that folding is pathway-independent (Levinthal's paradox). In contrast, the new view sees no inherent paradox because it eliminates the pathway idea: folding can funnel to a single stable state by multiple routes in conformational space. The general energy landscape picture provides a conceptual framework for understanding both two-state and multi-state folding kinetics. Better tests of these ideas will come when new experiments become available for measuring not just averages of structural observables, but also correlations among their fluctuations. At that point we hope to learn much more about the real shapes of protein folding landscapes.},

	Abstract = {The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions.},

	Abstract = {A large body of evidence indicates that disturbances of Ca(2+) homeostasis may be a causative factor in the neurotoxicity following cerebral ischemia. However, the mechanisms by which Ca(2+) overload leads to neuronal cell death have not been fully elucidated. Calmodulin, a major intracellular Ca(2+)-binding protein found mainly in the central nervous system, mediates many physiological functions in response to changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, whereas Ca(2+) overload in neurons after excitotoxic insult may induce excessive activation of calmodulin signaling pathways, leading to neuronal cell death. To determine the role of calmodulin in the induction of neuronal cell death, we generated primary rat cortical neurons that express a mutant calmodulin with a defect in Ca(2+)-binding affinity. Neurons expressing the mutant had low responses of calmodulin-dependent signaling to membrane depolarization by high KCl and became resistant to glutamate-triggered excitotoxic neuronal cell death compared with the vector or wild-type calmodulin-transfected cells, indicating that blocking calmodulin function is protective against excitotoxic insult. These results suggest that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the processes of Ca(2+)-induced neuronal cell death and the possibility that the blockage of calmodulin attenuates brain injury after cerebral ischemia.},

	Abstract = {Lead (Pb2+), a heavy metal, has been used by humans for many technological purposes, which is the main reason for its present widespread distribution. Although various actions have been taken to decrease the use and distribution of lead in the environment, it remains a significant health hazard. The toxic mechanism of lead is caused by its ability to substitute for other polyvalent cations (particularly divalent cations, such as calcium [Ca2+] and zinc [Zn2+]) in the molecular machinery of living organisms. These interactions allow lead to affect different biologically significant processes, including metal transport, energy metabolism, apoptosis, ionic conduction, cell adhesion, inter- and intracellular signaling, diverse enzymatic processes, protein maturation, and genetic regulation. Membrane ionic channels and signaling molecules seem to be one of the most relevant molecular targets contributing to lead's neurotoxicity; the developing central nervous system is particularly susceptible. At critical times in development, lead may have a disorganizing influence with long-lasting effects that may continue into teenage years and beyond. Pediatric lead poisoning is more common than adult lead poisoning, and its effects may occur at reduced blood levels with subclinical symptoms, thus a high index of suspicion is necessary for physicians when dealing with pediatric patients. Long-term effects of lead poisoning may produce cognitive and motor impairment, with behavioral alterations. This review is centered on the description of the molecular mechanisms of lead toxicity and its repercussions on cellular functions.},

Conformational flexibility plays a key role in CaM function, although the full extent and detailed features of this flexibility are not fully characterized. Here, the 1.75 A resolution crystal structure of Pb(2+)-bound Paramecium tetraurelia CaM crystallized in a previously unobserved monoclinic lattice is reported. Pb(2+)-CaM is disordered in this new lattice and only a portion of each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit can be modeled. Comparison of the structures of Ca(2+)-CaM and Pb(2+)-CaM show close agreement in the C-terminal domain but significant structural differences in the N-terminal domain. In addition, translation-libration-screw (TLS) refinement and Rosenfield difference analysis reveal inter-helical flexibility in the metal-bound N-terminal domain of the protein that is absent in the metal-bound C-terminal domain and indicates that the two structurally similar domains of CaM are dynamically distinct. These results demonstrate that TLS refinement and Rosenfield difference analysis allow detailed information about macromolecular flexibility to be extracted from X-ray diffraction data even when the crystal lattice prohibits full manifestation of this flexibility.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a multifunctional Ca2+-binding protein that regulates the activity of many enzymes in response to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. There are two globular domains in CaM, each containing a pair of helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs called EF-hands. Ca2+-binding induces the opening of both domains thereby exposing hydrophobic pockets that provide binding sites for the target enzymes. Here, I present a 2.4 A resolution structure of a calmodulin mutant (CaM41/75) in which the N-terminal domain is locked in the closed conformation by a disulfide bond. CaM41/75 crystallized in a tetragonal lattice with the Ca2+ bound in all four EF-hands. In the closed N-terminal domain Ca ions are coordinated by the four protein ligands in positions 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the loop, and by two solvent ligands. The glutamate side-chain in the 12th position of the loop (Glu31 in site I and Glu67 in site II), which in the wild-type protein provides a bidentate Ca2+ ligand, remains in a distal position. Based on a comparison of CaM41/75 with other CaM and troponin C structures a detailed two-step mechanism of the Ca2+-binding process is proposed. Initially, the Ca2+ binds to the N-terminal part of the loop, thus generating a rigid link between the incoming helix (helix A, or helix C) and the central beta structure involving the residues in the sixth, seventh and eighth position of the loop. Then, the exiting helix (helix B or helix D) rotates causing the glutamate ligand in the 12th position to move into the vicinity of the immobilized Ca2+. An adjustment of the phi, psi backbone dihedral angles of the Ile residue in the eighth position is necessary and sufficient for the helix rotation and functions as a hinge. The model allows for a significant independence of the Ca2+-binding sites in a two-EF-hand domain.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that the Ca2+-saturated E140Q mutant of the C-terminal domain of calmodulin exhibits equilibrium exchange between "open" and "closed" conformations similar to those of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated states of wild-type calmodulin. The backbone dynamics of this mutant were studied using15N spin relaxation experiments at three different temperatures. Measurements at each temperature of the15N rate constants for longitudinal and transverse auto-relaxation, longitudinal and transverse cross-correlation relaxation, and the1H-15N cross-relaxation afforded unequivocal identification of conformational exchange processes on microsecond to millisecond time-scales, and characterization of fast fluctuations on picosecond to nanosecond time-scales using model-free approaches. The results show that essentially all residues of the protein are involved in conformational exchange. Generalized order parameters of the fast internal motions indicate that the conformational substates are well folded, and exclude the possibility that the exchange involves a significant population of unfolded or disordered species. The temperature dependence of the order parameters offers qualitative estimates of the contribution to the heat capacity from fast fluctuations of the protein backbone, revealing significant variation between the well-ordered secondary structure elements and the more flexible regions. The temperature dependence of the conformational exchange contributions to the transverse auto-relaxation rate constants directly demonstrates that the microscopic exchange rate constants are greater than 2.7x10(3)s-1at 291 K. The conformational exchange contributions correlate with the chemical shift differences between the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated states of the wild-type protein, thereby substantiating that the conformational substates are similar to the open and closed states of wild-type calmodulin. Taking the wild-type chemical shifts to represent the conformational substates of the mutant and populations estimated previously, the microscopic exchange rate constants could be estimated as 2x10(4)to 3x10(4)s-1at 291 K for a subset of residues. The temperature depen dence of the exchange allows the characterization of apparent energy barriers of the conformational transition, with results suggesting a complex process that does not correspond to a single global transition between substates.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin undergoes Ca2+-induced structural rearrangements that are intimately coupled to the regulation of numerous cellular processes. The C-terminal domain of calmodulin has previously been observed to exhibit conformational exchange in the absence of Ca2+. Here, we characterize further the conformational dynamics in the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ using 15N spin relaxation experiments. The analysis included 1H-15N dipolar/15N chemical shift anisotropy interference cross-correlation relaxation rates to improve the description of the exchange processes, as well as the picosecond to nanosecond dynamics. Conformational transitions on microsecond to millisecond time scales were revealed by exchange contributions to the transverse auto-relaxation rates. In order to separate the effects of Ca2+ exchange from intramolecular conformational exchange processes in the apo state, transverse auto-relaxation rates were measured at different concentrations of free Ca2+. The results reveal a Ca2+-dependent contribution due mainly to exchange between the apo and (Ca2+)1 states with an apparent Ca2+ off-rate of approximately 5115 s(-1), as well as Ca2+-independent contributions due to conformational exchange within the apo state. 15N chemical shift differences estimated from the exchange data suggest that the first Ca2+ binds preferentially to loop IV. Thus, characterization of chemical exchange as a function of Ca2+ concentration has enabled the extraction of unique information on the rapidly exchanging and weakly populated (<10 \%) (Ca2+)1 state that is otherwise inaccessible to direct study due to strongly cooperative Ca2+ binding. The conformational exchange within the apo state appears to involve transitions between a predominantly populated closed conformation and a smaller population of more open conformations. The picosecond to nanosecond dynamics of the apo state are typical of a well-folded protein, with reduced amplitudes of motions in the helical segments, but with significant flexibility in the Ca2+-binding loops. Comparisons with order parameters for skeletal troponin C and calbindin D9k reveal key structural and dynamical differences that correlate with the different Ca2+-binding properties of these proteins.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calmodulin is a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-activated regulator of cellular processes in eukaryotes. The structures of the Ca(2+)-free (apo) and Ca(2+)-loaded states of calmodulin have revealed that Ca(2+) binding is associated with a transition in each of the two domains from a closed to an open conformation that is central to target recognition. However, little is known about the dynamics of this conformational switch. RESULTS: The dynamics of the transition between closed and open conformations in the Ca(2+)-loaded state of the E140Q mutant of the calmodulin C-terminal domain were characterized under equilibrium conditions. The exchange time constants (tau(ex)) measured for 42 residues range from 13 to 46 micros, with a mean of 21 +/- 3 micros. The results suggest that tau(ex) varies significantly between different groups of residues and that residues with similar values exhibit spatial proximity in the structures of apo and/or Ca(2+)-saturated wild-type calmodulin. Using data for one of these groups, we obtained an open population of p(o) = 0.50 +/- 0.17 and a closed --> open rate constant of k(o) = x 10(4) s(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The conformational exchange dynamics appear to involve locally collective processes that depend on the structural topology. Comparisons with previous results indicate that similar processes occur in the wild-type protein. The measured rates match the estimated Ca(2+) off rate, suggesting that Ca(2+) release may be gated by the conformational dynamics. Structural interpretation of estimated chemical shifts suggests a mechanism for ion release.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear spin relaxation is a powerful method for studying molecular dynamics at atomic resolution. Recent methods development in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy has enabled detailed investigations of molecular dynamics that are critical for biological function, with prominent examples addressing allostery, enzyme catalysis, and protein folding. Dynamic processes with similar correlation times are often detected in multiple locations of the molecule, raising the question of whether the underlying motions are correlated (corresponding to concerted fluctuations involving many atoms distributed across extended regions of the molecule) or uncorrelated (corresponding to independent fluctuations involving few atoms in localized regions). Here, we have used (13)C(alpha)(i - 1)/(13)C(alpha)(i) differential multiple-quantum spin relaxation to provide direct evidence for correlated dynamics of consecutive amino acid residues in the protein sequence. By monitoring overlapping pairs of residues (i - 1 and i, i and i + 1, etc.), we identified correlated motions that extend through continuous segments of the sequence. We detected significant correlated conformational transitions in the native state of the E140Q mutant of the calmodulin C-terminal domain. Previous work has shown that this domain exchanges between two major conformational states that resemble the functionally relevant open and closed states of the WT protein, with a mean correlation time of approximately 20 micros. The present results reveal that an entire alpha-helix undergoes partial unraveling in a transient and cooperative manner.},

	Abstract = {The calcium binding proteins of the EF-hand super-family are involved in the regulation of all aspects of cell function. These proteins exhibit a great diversity of composition, structure, Ca2+-binding and target interaction properties. Here, our current understanding of the Ca2+-binding mechanism is assessed. The structures of the EF-hand motifs containing 11-14 amino acid residues in the Ca2+-binding loop are analyzed within the framework of the recently proposed two-step Ca2+-binding mechanism. A hypothesis is put forward that in all EF-hand proteins the Ca2+-binding and the resultant conformational responses are governed by the central structure connecting the Ca2+-binding loops in the two-EF-hand domain. This structure, named EFbeta-scaffold, defines the position of the bound Ca2+, and coordinates the function of the N-terminal (variable and flexible) with the C-terminal (invariable and rigid) parts of the Ca2+-binding loop. It is proposed that the nature of the first ligand of the Ca2+-binding loop is an important determinant of the conformational change. Additional factors, including the interhelical contacts, the length, structure and flexibility of the linker connecting the EF-hand motifs, and the overall energy balance provide the fine-tuning of the Ca2+-induced conformational change in the EF-hand proteins.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms that allow or constrain protein movement have not been understood. Here we study interdomain interactions in proteins to investigate hinge-bending motions. RESULTS: We find a limited number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds at the interdomain interface, in both the "closed" and the "open" conformations. Consistently, analysis of 222 salt bridges in an independently selected database indicates that most salt bridges form within rather than between independently folding hydrophobic units. Calculations show that these interdomain salt bridges either destabilize or only marginally stabilize the closed conformation in most proteins. In contrast, the nonpolar buried surface area between the moving parts can be extensive in the closed conformations. However, when the nonpolar buried surface area is large, we find that at the interdomain interface in the open conformation it may be as large or larger than in the closed conformation. Hence, the energetic penalty of opening the closed conformation is overcome. Consistently, a large nonpolar surface area buried in the closed interdomain interface accompanies limited opening of the domains, yielding a larger interface. CONCLUSIONS: Short-range electrostatic interactions are largely absent between moving domains. Interdomain nonpolar buried surface area may be large in the closed conformation, but it is largely offset by the area buried in the open conformation. In such cases the opening of the domains appears to be relatively small. This may allow prediction of the extent of domain opening. Such predictions may have implications for the shape and size of the binding pockets in drug/protein design.},

	Abstract = {Allostery has come of age; the number, breadth and functional roles of documented protein allostery cases are rising quickly. Since all dynamic proteins are potentially allosteric and allostery plays crucial roles in all cellular pathways, sorting and classifying allosteric mechanisms in proteins should be extremely useful in understanding and predicting how the signals are regulated and transmitted through the dynamic multi-molecular cellular organizations. Classification organizes the complex information thereby unraveling relationships and patterns in molecular activation and repression. In signaling, current classification schemes consider classes of molecules according to their functions; for example, epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the central nervous system are classified as neurotransmitters. Other schemes would account for epinephrine when secreted by the adrenal medulla to be hormone-like. Yet, such classifications account for the global function of the molecule; not for the molecular mechanism of how the signal transmission initiates and how it is transmitted. Here we provide a unified view of allostery and the first classification framework. We expect that a classification scheme would assist in comprehension of allosteric mechanisms, in prediction of signaling on the molecular level, in better comprehension of pathways and regulation of the complex signals, in translating them to the cascading events, and in allosteric drug design. We further provide a range of examples illustrating mechanisms in protein allostery and their classification from the cellular functional standpoint.},

	Abstract = {Most proteins exist in the cell as multi-component assemblies. However, which proteins need to be present simultaneously in order to perform a given function is frequently unknown. The first step toward this goal would be to predict proteins that can function only when in a complexed form. Here, we propose a scheme to distinguish whether the protein components are ordered (stable) or disordered when separated from their complexed partners. We analyze structural characteristics of several types of complexes, such as natively unstructured proteins, ribosomal proteins, two-state and three-state complexes, and crystal-packing dimers. Our analysis makes use of the fact that natively unstructured proteins, which undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding their partner, and stable monomeric proteins, which exist as dimers only in their crystal form, provide examples of two vastly different scenarios. We find that ordered monomers can be distinguished from disordered monomers on the basis of the per-residue surface and interface areas, which are significantly smaller for ordered proteins. With this scale, two-state dimers (where the monomers unfold upon dimer separation) and ribosomal proteins are shown to resemble disordered proteins. On the other hand, crystal-packing dimers, whose monomers are stable in solution, fall into the ordered protein category. While there should be a continuum in the distributions, nevertheless, the per-residue scale measures the confidence in the determination of whether a protein can exist as a stable monomer. Further analysis, focusing on the chemical and contact preferences at the interface, interior and exposed surface areas, reveals that disordered proteins lack a strong hydrophobic core and are composed of highly polar surface area. We discuss the implication of our results for de novo design of stable monomeric proteins and peptides.},

	Abstract = {Whereas previously we have successfully utilized the folding funnels concept to rationalize binding mechanisms (Ma B, Kumar S, Tsai CJ, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Eng 12:713-720) and to describe binding (Tsai CJ, Kumar S, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Sci. 8:1181-1190), here we further extend the concept of folding funnels, illustrating its utility in explaining enzyme pathways, multimolecular associations, and allostery. This extension is based on the recognition that funnels are not stationary; rather, they are dynamic, depending on the physical or binding conditions (Tsai CJ, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:9970-9972). Different binding states change the surrounding environment of proteins. The changed environment is in turn expressed in shifted energy landscapes, with different shapes and distributions of populations of conformers. Hence, the function of a protein and its properties are not only decided by the static folded three-dimensional structure; they are determined by the distribution of its conformational substates, and in particular, by the redistributions of the populations under different environments. That is, protein function derives from its dynamic energy landscape, caused by changes in its surroundings.},

@article{tsai:99,
	Abstract = {Folding funnels have been the focus of considerable attention during the last few years. These have mostly been discussed in the general context of the theory of protein folding. Here we extend the utility of the concept of folding funnels, relating them to biological mechanisms and function. In particular, here we describe the shape of the funnels in light of protein synthesis and folding; flexibility, conformational diversity, and binding mechanisms; and the associated binding funnels, illustrating the multiple routes and the range of complexed conformers. Specifically, the walls of the folding funnels, their crevices, and bumps are related to the complexity of protein folding, and hence to sequential vs. nonsequential folding. Whereas the former is more frequently observed in eukaryotic proteins, where the rate of protein synthesis is slower, the latter is more frequent in prokaryotes, with faster translation rates. The bottoms of the funnels reflect the extent of the flexibility of the proteins. Rugged floors imply a range of conformational isomers, which may be close on the energy landscape. Rather than undergoing an induced fit binding mechanism, the conformational ensembles around the rugged bottoms argue that the conformers, which are most complementary to the ligand, will bind to it with the equilibrium shifting in their favor. Furthermore, depending on the extent of the ruggedness, or of the smoothness with only a few minima, we may infer nonspecific, broad range vs. specific binding. In particular, folding and binding are similar processes, with similar underlying principles. Hence, the shape of the folding funnel of the monomer enables making reasonable guesses regarding the shape of the corresponding binding funnel. Proteins having a broad range of binding, such as proteolytic enzymes or relatively nonspecific endonucleases, may be expected to have not only rugged floors in their folding funnels, but their binding funnels will also behave similarly, with a range of complexed conformations. Hence, knowledge of the shape of the folding funnels is biologically very useful. The converse also holds: If kinetic and thermodynamic data are available, hints regarding the role of the protein and its binding selectivity may be obtained. Thus, the utility of the concept of the funnel carries over to the origin of the protein and to its function.},

	Abstract = {The interaction of a ligand with a protein occurs at a local site (the binding site) and involves only a few residues; however, the effects of that interaction are often propagated to remote locations. The chain of events initiated by binding provides the basis for fundamental biological phenomena such as allosterism, signal transduction, and structural-stability modification. In this paper, a structure-based statistical thermodynamic approach is presented and used to predict the propagation of the stabilization effects triggered by the binding of the monoclonal antibody D1.3 to hen egg white lysozyme. Previously, Williams et al. [Williams, D. C., Benjamin, D. C., Poljak, R. J. \& Rule, G. S. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 257, 866-876] showed that the binding of this antibody affects the stability of hen egg white lysozyme and that the binding effects propagate to a selected number of residues at remote locations from the binding epitope. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be predicted from structure. The formalism presented here permits the identification of the structural path followed by cooperative interactions that originate at the binding site. It is shown that an important condition for the propagation of binding effects to distal regions is the presence of a significant fraction of residues with low structural stability in the uncomplexed binding site. A survey of protein structures indicates that many binding sites have a dual character and are defined by regions of high and low structural stabilities. The low-stability regions might be involved in the transmission of binding information to other regions in the protein.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exist and function without well-defined three-dimensional structures, thus they defy the classical structure-function paradigm. These proteins are common in proteomes, and they carry out essential functions often related to signalling and regulation of transcription. Herein, the experimental evidence for their lack of structure and the major functional benefits that structural disorder confers, are surveyed. It is shown that IDPs often function by molecular recognition, in which either short motifs, or domain-sized disordered segments are used for partner recognition. In both cases, the binding segment undergoes induced folding and it attains an ordered structure. This folding-upon-binding scenario suggests that the function of IDPs can be interpreted in terms of the static structural view of the classical paradigm. New developments in the field, however, suggest that folding upon binding is limited, and many IDPs preserve a significant level of disorder in the bound state, a phenomenon termed fuzziness. In addition, IDPs may structurally adapt to different partners with different functional outcomes, resulting in promiscuity in function termed moonlighting. It is suggested that a new model describing the structure-function relationship of IDPs has to encompass such structural and functional promiscuity inherent in the disordered state of IDPs.},

	Abstract = {Proteins can exist in a trinity of structures: the ordered state, the molten globule, and the random coil. The five following examples suggest that native protein structure can correspond to any of the three states (not just the ordered state) and that protein function can arise from any of the three states and their transitions. (1) In a process that likely mimics infection, fd phage converts from the ordered into the disordered molten globular state. (2) Nucleosome hyperacetylation is crucial to DNA replication and transcription; this chemical modification greatly increases the net negative charge of the nucleosome core particle. We propose that the increased charge imbalance promotes its conversion to a much less rigid form. (3) Clusterin contains an ordered domain and also a native molten globular region. The molten globular domain likely functions as a proteinaceous detergent for cell remodeling and removal of apoptotic debris. (4) In a critical signaling event, a helix in calcineurin becomes bound and surrounded by calmodulin, thereby turning on calcineurin's serine/threonine phosphatase activity. Locating the calcineurin helix within a region of disorder is essential for enabling calmodulin to surround its target upon binding. (5) Calsequestrin regulates calcium levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by binding approximately 50 ions/molecule. Disordered polyanion tails at the carboxy terminus bind many of these calcium ions, perhaps without adopting a unique structure. In addition to these examples, we will discuss 16 more proteins with native disorder. These disordered regions include molecular recognition domains, protein folding inhibitors, flexible linkers, entropic springs, entropic clocks, and entropic bristles. Motivated by such examples of intrinsic disorder, we are studying the relationships between amino acid sequence and order/disorder, and from this information we are predicting intrinsic order/disorder from amino acid sequence. The sequence-structure relationships indicate that disorder is an encoded property, and the predictions strongly suggest that proteins in nature are much richer in intrinsic disorder than are those in the Protein Data Bank. Recent predictions on 29 genomes indicate that proteins from eucaryotes apparently have more intrinsic disorder than those from either bacteria or archaea, with typically > 30\% of eucaryotic proteins having disordered regions of length > or = 50 consecutive residues.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) signaling involves important, wide spread eukaryotic protein-protein interactions. The solved structures of CaM associated with several of its binding targets, the distinctive binding mechanism of CaM, and the significant trypsin sensitivity of the binding targets combine to indicate that the process of association likely involves coupled binding and folding for both CaM and its binding targets. Here, we use bioinformatics approaches to test the hypothesis that CaM-binding targets are intrinsically disordered. We developed a predictor of CaM-binding regions and estimated its performance. Per residue accuracy of this predictor reached 81\%, which, in combination with a high recall/precision balance at the binding region level, suggests high predictability of CaM-binding partners. An analysis of putative CaM-binding proteins in yeast and human strongly indicates that their molecular functions are related to those of intrinsically disordered proteins. These findings add to the growing list of examples in which intrinsically disordered protein regions are indicated to provide the basis for cell signaling and regulation.},

	Abstract = {The Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt) links structure and function information for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Intrinsically disordered proteins do not form a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, either in their entireties or in segments or regions. We define IDP as a protein that contains at least one experimentally determined disordered region. Although lacking fixed structure, IDPs and regions carry out important biological functions, being typically involved in regulation, signaling and control. Such functions can involve high-specificity low-affinity interactions, the multiple binding of one protein to many partners and the multiple binding of many proteins to one partner. These three features are all enabled and enhanced by protein intrinsic disorder. One of the major hindrances in the study of IDPs has been the lack of organized information. DisProt was developed to enable IDP research by collecting and organizing knowledge regarding the experimental characterization and the functional associations of IDPs. In addition to being a unique source of biological information, DisProt opens doors for a plethora of bioinformatics studies. DisProt is openly available at http://www.disprot.org.},

	Abstract = {The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the preeminent source of protein structural information. PDB contains over 32,500 experimentally determined 3-D structures solved using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Intrinsically disordered regions fail to form a fixed 3-D structure under physiological conditions. In this study, we compare the amino-acid sequences of proteins whose structures are determined by X-ray crystallography with the corresponding sequences from the Swiss-Prot database. The analyzed dataset includes 16,370 structures, which represent 18,101 PDB chains and 5,434 different proteins from 910 different organisms (2,793 eukaryotic, 2,109 bacterial, 288 viral, and 244 archaeal). In this dataset, on average, each Swiss-Prot protein is represented by 7 PDB chains with 76\% of the crystallized regions being represented by more than one structure. Intriguingly, the complete sequences of only approximately 7\% of proteins are observed in the corresponding PDB structures, and only approximately 25\% of the total dataset have >95\% of their lengths observed in the corresponding PDB structures. This suggests that the vast majority of PDB proteins is shorter than their corresponding Swiss-Prot sequences and/or contain numerous residues, which are not observed in maps of electron density. To determine the prevalence of disordered regions in PDB, the residues in the Swiss-Prot sequences were grouped into four general categories, "Observed" (which correspond to structured regions), "Not observed" (regions with missing electron density, potentially disordered), "Uncharacterized," and "Ambiguous," depending on their appearance in the corresponding PDB entries. This non-redundant set of residues can be viewed as a 'fragment' or empirical domain database that contains a set of experimentally determined structured regions or domains and a set of experimentally verified disordered regions or domains. We studied the propensities and properties of residues in these four categories and analyzed their relations to the predictions of disorder using several algorithms. "Non-observed," "Ambiguous," and "Uncharacterized" regions were shown to possess the amino acid compositional biases typical of intrinsically disordered proteins. The application of four different disorder predictors (PONDR(R) VL-XT, VL3-BA, VSL1P, and IUPred) revealed that the vast majority of residues in the "Observed" dataset are ordered, and that the "Not observed" regions are mostly disordered. The "Uncharacterized" regions possess some tendency toward order, whereas the predictions for the short "Ambiguous" regions are really ambiguous. Long "Ambiguous" regions (>70 amino acid residues) are mostly predicted to be ordered, suggesting that they are likely to be "wobbly" domains. Overall, we showed that completely ordered proteins are not highly abundant in PDB and many PDB sequences have disordered regions. In fact, in the analyzed dataset approximately 10\% of the PDB proteins contain regions of consecutive missing or ambiguous residues longer than 30 amino-acids and approximately 40\% of the proteins possess short regions (> or =10 and < 30 amino-acid long) of missing and ambiguous residues.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary and/or secondary structures under physiological conditions in vitro. They are highly abundant in nature and their functional repertoire complements the functions of ordered proteins. IDPs are involved in regulation, signaling, and control, where binding to multiple partners and high-specificity/low-affinity interactions play a crucial role. Functions of IDPs are tuned via alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. Intrinsic disorder is a unique structural feature that enables IDPs to participate in both one-to-many and many-to-one signaling. Numerous IDPs are associated with human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Overall, intriguing interconnections among intrinsic disorder, cell signaling, and human diseases suggest that protein conformational diseases may result not only from protein misfolding, but also from misidentification, missignaling, and unnatural or nonnative folding. IDPs, such as alpha-synuclein, tau protein, p53, and BRCA1, are attractive targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interactions. From these and other examples, novel strategies for drug discovery based on IDPs have been developed. To summarize work in this area, we are introducing the D2 (disorder in disorders) concept.},

@article{dunker:08a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our first predictor of protein disorder was published just over a decade ago in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (Romero P, Obradovic Z, Kissinger C, Villafranca JE, Dunker AK (1997) Identifying disordered regions in proteins from amino acid sequence. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, 1: 90-95). By now more than twenty other laboratory groups have joined the efforts to improve the prediction of protein disorder. While the various prediction methodologies used for protein intrinsic disorder resemble those methodologies used for secondary structure prediction, the two types of structures are entirely different. For example, the two structural classes have very different dynamic properties, with the irregular secondary structure class being much less mobile than the disorder class. The prediction of secondary structure has been useful. On the other hand, the prediction of intrinsic disorder has been revolutionary, leading to major modifications of the more than 100 year-old views relating protein structure and function. Experimentalists have been providing evidence over many decades that some proteins lack fixed structure or are disordered (or unfolded) under physiological conditions. In addition, experimentalists are also showing that, for many proteins, their functions depend on the unstructured rather than structured state; such results are in marked contrast to the greater than hundred year old views such as the lock and key hypothesis. Despite extensive data on many important examples, including disease-associated proteins, the importance of disorder for protein function has been largely ignored. Indeed, to our knowledge, current biochemistry books don't present even one acknowledged example of a disorder-dependent function, even though some reports of disorder-dependent functions are more than 50 years old. The results from genome-wide predictions of intrinsic disorder and the results from other bioinformatics studies of intrinsic disorder are demanding attention for these proteins. RESULTS: Disorder prediction has been important for showing that the relatively few experimentally characterized examples are members of a very large collection of related disordered proteins that are wide-spread over all three domains of life. Many significant biological functions are now known to depend directly on, or are importantly associated with, the unfolded or partially folded state. Here our goal is to review the key discoveries and to weave these discoveries together to support novel approaches for understanding sequence-function relationships. CONCLUSION: Intrinsically disordered protein is common across the three domains of life, but especially common among the eukaryotic proteomes. Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are frequently, or very likely most often, located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions are coupled with the adoption of different structures with different partners. Also, the flexibility of intrinsic disorder helps different disordered regions to bind to a common binding site on a common partner. Such capacity for binding diversity plays important roles in both protein-protein interaction networks and likely also in gene regulation networks. Such disorder-based signaling is further modulated in multicellular eukaryotes by alternative splicing, for which such splicing events map to regions of disorder much more often than to regions of structure. Associating alternative splicing with disorder rather than structure alleviates theoretical and experimentally observed problems associated with the folding of different length, isomeric amino acid sequences. The combination of disorder and alternative splicing is proposed to provide a mechanism for easily "trying out" different signaling pathways, thereby providing the mechanism for generating signaling diversity and enabling the evolution of cell differentiation and multicellularity. Finally, several recent small molecules of interest as potential drugs have been shown to act by blocking protein-protein interactions based on intrinsic disorder of one of the partners. Study of these examples has led to a new approach for drug discovery, and bioinformatics analysis of the human proteome suggests that various disease-associated proteins are very rich in such disorder-based drug discovery targets.},

@article{kumar:99,
	Abstract = {In this article we focus on presenting a broad range of examples illustrating low-energy transitions via hinge-bending motions. The examples are divided according to the type of hinge-bending involved; namely, motions involving fragments of the protein chains, hinge-bending motions involving protein domains, and hinge-bending motions between the covalently unconnected subunits. We further make a distinction between allosterically and nonallosterically regulated proteins. These transitions are discussed within the general framework of folding and binding funnels. We propose that the conformers manifesting such swiveling motions are not the outcome of "induced fit" binding mechanism; instead, molecules exist in an ensemble of conformations that are in equilibrium in solution. These ensembles, which populate the bottoms of the funnels, a priori contain both the "open" and the "closed" conformational isomers. Furthermore, we argue that there are no fundamental differences among the physical principles behind the folding and binding funnels. Hence, there is no basic difference between funnels depicting ensembles of conformers of single molecules with fragment, or domain motions, as compared to subunits in multimeric quaternary structures, also showing such conformational transitions. The difference relates only to the size and complexity of the system. The larger the system, the more complex its corresponding fused funnel(s). In particular, funnels associated with allosterically regulated proteins are expected to be more complicated, because allostery is frequently involved with movements between subunits, and consequently is often observed in multichain and multimolecular complexes. This review centers on the critical role played by flexibility and conformational fluctuations in enzyme activity. Internal motions that extend over different time scales and with different amplitudes are known to be essential for the catalytic cycle. The conformational change observed in enzyme-substrate complexes as compared to the unbound enzyme state, and in particular the hinge-bending motions observed in enzymes with two domains, have a substantial effect on the enzymatic catalytic activity. The examples we review span the lipolytic enzymes that are particularly interesting, owing to their activation at the water-oil interface; an allosterically controlled dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase); a DNA methyltransferase, with a covalently-bound intermediate; large-scale flexible loop motions in a glycolytic enzyme (TIM); domain motion in PGK, an enzyme which is essential in most cells, both for ATP generation in aerobes and for fermentation in anaerobes; adenylate kinase, showing large conformational changes, owing to their need to shield their catalytic centers from water; a calcium-binding protein (calmodulin), involved in a wide range of cellular calcium-dependent signaling; diphtheria toxin, whose large domain motion has been shown to yield "domain swapping;" the hexameric glutamate dehydrogenase, which has been studied both in a thermophile and in a mesophile; an allosteric enzyme, showing subunit motion between the R and the T states (aspartate transcarbamoylase), and the historically well-studied lac repressor. Nonallosteric subunit transitions are also addressed, with some examples (aspartate receptor and BamHI endonuclease). Hence, using this enzyme-catalysis-centered discussion, we address energy funnel landscapes of large-scale conformational transitions, rather than the faster, quasi-harmonic, thermal fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Biomolecules often undergo large-amplitude motions when they bind or release other molecules. Unlike macroscopic machines, these biomolecular machines can partially disassemble (unfold) and then reassemble (fold) during such transitions. Here we put forward a minimal structure-based model, the "multiple-basin model," that can directly be used for molecular dynamics simulation of even very large biomolecular systems so long as the endpoints of the conformational change are known. We investigate the model by simulating large-scale motions of four proteins: glutamine-binding protein, S100A6, dihydrofolate reductase, and HIV-1 protease. The mechanisms of conformational transition depend on the protein basin topologies and change with temperature near the folding transition. The conformational transition rate varies linearly with driving force over a fairly large range. This linearity appears to be a consequence of partial unfolding during the conformational transition.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale motions of biomolecules involve linear elastic deformations along low-frequency normal modes, but for function nonlinearity is essential. In addition, unlike macroscopic machines, biological machines can locally break and then reassemble during function. We present a model for global structural transformations, such as allostery, that involve large-scale motion and possible partial unfolding, illustrating the method with the conformational transition of adenylate kinase. Structural deformation between open and closed states occurs via low-frequency modes on separate reactant and product surfaces, switching from one state to the other when energetically favorable. The switching model is the most straightforward anharmonic interpolation, which allows the barrier for a process to be estimated from a linear normal mode calculation, which by itself cannot be used for activated events. Local unfolding, or cracking, occurs in regions where the elastic stress becomes too high during the transition. Cracking leads to a counterintuitive catalytic effect of added denaturant on allosteric enzyme function. It also leads to unusual relationships between equilibrium constant and rate like those seen recently in single-molecule experiments of motor proteins.},

	Abstract = {The key to understand a protein's function often lies in its conformational dynamics. We develop a coarse-grained variational model to investigate the interplay between structural transitions, conformational flexibility, and function of the N-terminal calmodulin domain (nCaM). In this model, two energy basins corresponding to the "closed" apo conformation and "open" holo conformation of nCaM are coupled by a uniform interpolation parameter. The resulting detailed transition route from our model is largely consistent with the recently proposed EFbeta-scaffold mechanism in EF-hand family proteins. We find that the N-terminal parts of the calcium binding loops shows higher flexibility than the C-terminal parts which form this EFbeta-scaffold structure. The structural transition of binding loops I and II are compared in detail. Our model predicts that binding loop II, with higher flexibility and earlier structural change than binding loop I, dominates the open/closed conformational transition in nCaM.},

	Abstract = {A full structural description of transition state ensembles in protein folding includes the specificity of the ordered residues composing the folding nucleus as well as spatial density. To our knowledge, the spatial properties of the folding nucleus and interface of specific nuclei have yet to receive significant attention. We analyze folding routes predicted by a variational model in terms of a generalized formalism of the capillarity scaling theory that assumes the volume of the folded core of the nucleus grows with chain length as V(f) approximately N(3nu). For 27 two-state proteins studied, the scaling exponent nu ranges from 0.2 to 0.45 with an average of 0.33. This average value corresponds to packing of rigid objects, although generally the effective monomer size in the folded core is larger than the corresponding volume per particle in the native-state ensemble. That is, on average, the folded core of the nucleus is found to be relatively diffuse. We also study the growth of the folding nucleus and interface along the folding route in terms of the density or packing fraction. The evolution of the folded core and interface regions can be classified into three patterns of growth depending on how the growth of the folded core is balanced by changes in density of the interface. Finally, we quantify the diffuse versus polarized structure of the critical nucleus through direct calculation of the packing fraction of the folded core and interface regions. Our results support the general picture of describing protein folding as the capillarity-like growth of folding nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We explore how inherent flexibility of a protein molecule influences the mechanism controlling allosteric transitions by using a variational model inspired from work in protein folding. The striking differences in the predicted transition mechanism for the opening of the two domains of calmodulin (CaM) emphasize that inherent flexibility is key to understanding the complex conformational changes that occur in proteins. In particular, the C-terminal domain of CaM (cCaM), which is inherently less flexible than its N-terminal domain (nCaM), reveals "cracking" or local partial unfolding during the open/closed transition. This result is in harmony with the picture that cracking relieves local stresses caused by conformational deformations of a sufficiently rigid protein. We also compare the conformational transition in a recently studied even-odd paired fragment of CaM. Our results rationalize the different relative binding affinities of the EF-hands in the engineered fragment compared with the intact odd-even paired EF-hands (nCaM and cCaM) in terms of changes in flexibility along the transition route. Aside from elucidating general theoretical ideas about the cracking mechanism, these studies also emphasize how the remarkable intrinsic plasticity of CaM underlies conformational dynamics essential for its diverse functions.},
